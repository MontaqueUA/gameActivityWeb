Legendary Chalice now grants Super Arts with a blast of magical energy! Mummies explode in a shower of confetti! Dozens of other dazzling additions and adjustments throughout the game!\r\n\r\n• Bug fixes and tweaks!\r\n\r\n• And more!\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] In order to bring you all of these new features and enhancements, we've had to update Cuphead to a newer version of Unity. Accordingly, this new version of Unity doesn't support DX9, so all of the new updates and forthcoming DLC will only work with this new exclusively-DX11 version of Cuphead.\r\n\r\nIf you need to play Cuphead under DX9, we have made a DX9 branch of the game available under the Betas tab in the Properties window. By selecting \"legacy- 1.1.5 DX9\" version of the game, you will get the exact version of Cuphead that existed right before this new content update went live. Please note that this version will not contain any of the new Free Content Update features, nor will it work with the upcoming DLC.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1555605167,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":268910},{"gid":"2417771014045735444","title":"Cupdate - Mac Hotfix 1.1.5","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2417771014045735444","is_external_url":true,"author":"3x0x8","contents":"[h1]Hotfix Patch Notes 1.1.5[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis patch specifically addresses the following bugs in the Mac version of Cuphead:\r\n\r\n• Added or fixed controller compatibility with the following gamepads: Steam Controller, Xbox One Controllers connected via Bluetooth, and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.\r\n\r\n• Please Note: For the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, you will need to enable support in Steam under Settings > Controller.\r\n\r\n•  In addition, avoid syncing the Switch Pro controller if the Steam Controller is enabled at the same time, as this will cause a known conflict.\r\n\r\nTo all those newly discovering the Inkwell Isles on Mac - we hope you're having a wonderful Cuphead experience!","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1547062322,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":268910,"tags":["patchnotes"]},{"gid":"2403126706520372621","title":"Cuphead Available Now on Macintosh!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2403126706520372621","is_external_url":true,"author":"3x0x8","contents":"[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/29136746/eefabae885aadb9b34e459583146c49e2eafcdfe.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen the posts.
