It's not all about us. It's also about the developers, the people behind the virtual magic that inspired the creation of Eurogamer two decades ago. Without the developers, we wouldn't be here. And so, we thought we'd ask a few of them (20, in fact!) to pick the games that defined the last 20 years, and see what would come of it.</p><p>We approached a broad range of people, from top executives and legendary talent to tiny indies. We asked them to pick a game that defined the last 20 years, but left it up to them to interpret the question. It could be a game that defined the industry, that meant a lot to them professionally or personally, or is just a favourite.</p><p>We're delighted with the responses (thank you to everyone who contributed!).

Today, then, another batch, another five. And the theme...</em>\n  </p><p>Shops! Oh, how many virtual registers we've rung over the years. Imagine a role-playing game without one - you can't. It would be sacrilege. You simply must visit a new shop in every town and have their wares be slightly more powerful than they were where you came from. Everyone knows that. But there are so many shops, it's often hard to remember a single one.</p><p>It's not just RPGs. I remember ogling the superbikes for sale in Road Rash and then crashing them when I eventually saved up enough money to buy them. I remember spending ages shopping for shorts and T-shirts in a knock-off GAP in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. And I've probably spent more money than I should have on costumes in Fortnite, which is hardly my fault when they sell such silly costumes, is it?!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-27-five-of-the-best-shops\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1567166400,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":239350},{"gid":"2412161173662563103","title":"Spelunky 2 probably won't be out this year","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2412161173662563103","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p>Spelunky 2 was <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/spelunky-2-is-coming-and-has-a-new-main-character/\">announced</a> in 2017 and showed off its first <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-debut-spelunky-2-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-liquid-physics-and-online-multiplayer/\">gameplay</a> trailer in 2018, which is also when it revealed a release target of 2019.

You could run your hand over the plaster and feel the bumps and ridges where a doorway had been filled in. The weird thing is that there was a room-shaped gap on the other side of the wall, and no clear way of getting into it. It wasn't like the owner had decided to move the entrance to the bathroom, say. Instead, there was now a hidden room in the house - not very well hidden, granted - and who knew what was in there?</p><p>A hidden room. The effect is uncanny, I think - an intriguing, bewildering word which is even better in the original German, where it's unheimlich. Heimlich itself means secret or concealed, I gather. For years I had it in my head that it meant homelike. (<em>Heim</em> is the thing that got me confused.) Unhomelike is the best of all. What could be less homelike than discovering a hidden room in a place you think you have already come to know well?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-24-uncanny-games-with-hidden-rooms\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1553414400,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":239350},{"gid":"2539373912622938417","title":"Noita is Spelunky as magical, melting nightmare","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2539373912622938417","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Alec Meer)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/03/noita-preview.png/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/13/noita-preview/#more-658571\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Noita is Spelunky as magical, melting nightmare\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n","feedlabel":"Rock, Paper, Shotgun","date":1552471234,"feedname":"rps","feed_type":0,"appid":239350},{"gid":"2530366080596124915","title":"Podcast: Our proudest gaming achievements","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2530366080596124915","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (RPS)","contents":"<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/586420767&amp;color=%23009c7c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">   </span></iframe></p>\n<p>Life is hard and so are videogames.

It was infuriatingly difficult. Back in August of 2007 Derek Yu, now known as the creator of Spelunky, wrote it up for his website <a href=\"https://www.tigsource.com/2007/08/13/sexy-hiking/\" target=\"_blank\">TIGSource</a>, saying &quot;every new area seems totally impossible at first, and there is NOTHING THERE TO HELP YOU SAVE YOUR OWN GRIT.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>This strange game about a cartoon man with floating hands was made by an enigma from Poland known as &quot;Jazzuo&quot;. Jazzuo released a string of B-grade games online, small and ugly and odd things with control schemes that seemed designed by aliens. While rarely remembered today, they were an important influence on the indie games that would follow&#x2014;most obviously Sexy Hiking&apos;s spiritual sequel Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.</p><p>We asked Yu and Foddy to talk us through the strange world of Jazzuo, and B-games in general.</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, by Bennett Foddy</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>PC Gamer: How did you get into Jazzuo&apos;s games? What was the first one?</strong></p><p><strong>Bennett Foddy:</strong> I read about Sexy Hiking on Derek Yu&#x2019;s TIGSource website back in, oh, 2007 or so. Even then it had been out for a number of years, but Derek revived it with this post. As he anticipated, it was an extremely controversial title in the TIGSource community. Adam Saltsman (of Canabalt and Overland fame) called it &quot;the single worst game I have ever played&quot;. Honestly, at the time I dismissed the game, but it became something of a meme among indie game developers, and I never really forgot about it. Years later, I changed my opinion of the game when I showed it to my students at NYU, as part of a class on games by European developers, and I realized how timeless the design was.</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>I think Getting Over It is great because it brought outsider art to the masses in a respectful way. But it's still worth experiencing the original</p><figcaption><cite>Derek Yu</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>\n<p><strong>Derek Yu:</strong> The things I loved about Sexy Hiking are what I assume people love about Getting Over It now&#x2014;a unique and frustrating challenge coupled with a bizarre premise. Sexy Hiking does beat Getting Over It in one particular category, however, and that&apos;s the title. While &quot;Getting Over It&quot; is a good name and Bennett was, for a long time, considered an expert namer of games on the TIGSource Forums, I think even he would agree that &quot;Sexy Hiking&quot; is one of the best game names of all time.</p><p><strong>BF:</strong> Definitely one of the best titles! Other than Sexy Hiking, the best ones are Sexy Hand and GM Golf. Be careful, some of his games are in extremely poor taste!&#xA0;</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p>GM golf challenge, by Jazzuo</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>What are the most essential ones to play&#x2014;what&apos;s &apos;the Jazzuo canon&apos;?</strong></p><p><strong>DY:</strong> He created another game in 2007 called <a href=\"https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=485.0\" target=\"_blank\">Hermies the game</a> that was very similar in concept to 2016&apos;s Genital Jousting. I have no idea if the creators of Genital Jousting played Hermies, but either way it&apos;s proof that Jazzuo was ahead of his time. He made the game for the TIGSource B-Games Competition (which was partly inspired by him) and it won 4.5% of the votes but did not win the competition.</p><p>What makes Jazzuo&apos;s games so special to me is how raw they are. When I play a game by him or a similar creator, it always feels intimate and honest. As a game developer, it&apos;s tempting to start obsessing over polish and making sure the player has a nice, comfortable time, and his games are a reminder that we&apos;re also artists trying to express something of ourselves. I think Getting Over It is great because it brought outsider art to the masses in a respectful way. But it&apos;s still worth experiencing the original, since there are some aspects that can&apos;t be polished without losing something.</p><p><strong>BF:</strong> People also talk very fondly about his Star Wars Episode VII, but it&#x2019;s not online anymore and I haven&apos;t tried it. I recommend his other &apos;Sexy&apos; game, Sexy Hand II, which is a golf game with a similarly unusual control scheme, and GM Golf which is like a fusion of Sexy Hiking and Sexy Hand. He made games that were completely unconnected to this series, but personally I think his experimentation with mouse controls led to the most timeless work.&#xA0;</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p>Star Wars Episode VII, by Jazzuo</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Bennett, how did those students at NYU react to Sexy Hiking? And what is it you hope they get out of it?</strong><br>\n<br>\n<strong>BF:</strong> They reacted in much the same way as indie developers did in 2007&#x2014;they were polarized. Some of them became angry at it and refused to continue playing it, a few were captivated by it. I have showed so many old games to students, and honestly usually they can only take a dry academic interest because norms of user interaction and game design have moved on so much from the 80s and 90s. If they get really engaged in playing a game for enjoyment you know it must be timeless. Those games are really in the minority&#x2026; obviously people still enjoy Mario and Mega Man, but it&apos;s a real joy to me if I can find timeless games that American students are entirely unaware of: Alexei Pajitnov&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/shawl\" target=\"_blank\">Shawl</a>, David Braben&apos;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarch\" target=\"_blank\">Zarch</a>, Mike Singleton&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-21-dream-a-little-bigger-the-legacy-of-mike-singleton\" target=\"_blank\">Lords of Midnight</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p>Elasto Mania, by Bal  zs R  zsa</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>What is it about Sexy Hiking in particular that appealed to you?</strong></p><p><strong>BF</strong>: I&apos;m a big fan of messy, realtime physics puzzle games, going back to <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/how-a-17-year-old-community-is-keeping-elasto-mania-alive/\" target=\"_blank\">Elasto Mania</a> (the original Trials physics game) and <a href=\"https://www.fun-motion.com/physics-games/ski-stunt-simulator/\" target=\"_blank\">Ski Stunt Simulator</a>. That&apos;s a huge area of inspiration in my own work. But more than that Sexy Hiking just makes a very arresting first impression; there&apos;s something really unusual about how it looks, even though the quality is very low. I&apos;m a big believer in the power of games that have an original and powerful &apos;first screenshot&apos;.</p><p><strong>Sometimes people who make B-movies end up becoming almost folk heroes, like Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau, but that doesn&apos;t seem to happen in games. We don&apos;t have the same appreciation for B-games we have for B-movies. Why do you think that is?</strong>&#xA0;</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>...the other god of B-game development from Jazzuo's period is MDickie, whose magnum opus is The You Testament, a game about Jesus. </p><figcaption><cite>Bennett Foddy</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>\n<p><strong>DY:</strong> Videogames are still young compared to movies and it takes time to foster that kind of appreciation. But Jazzuo is certainly a folk hero to a lot of people in the indie game community and there&apos;s a YouTube video of someone beating Sexy Hiking which has over 128,000 views as I&apos;m writing this. Hopefully Getting Over It will keep bringing him to people&apos;s attention.</p><p><strong>BF:</strong> Culturally we just don&apos;t recognize the individuals who make games, even in the cases of solo-authored games. Of course there are exceptions, like Jonathan Blow or the great Japanese auteur designers, but generally game reviews and previews don&apos;t talk at all about the designers, game players don&apos;t know who the designers are, and game designers work actively to make sure their identities are invisible in their games and sometimes even in the credits. This is one of the main reasons I decided to insert myself in Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Jazzuo&apos;s a bit of an enigma, having disappeared from games entirely. Would you like to follow in his footsteps some day, just move on and leave a baffling legacy?</strong></p><p><strong>BF:</strong> Well, times are different, and I have given enough interviews now that I think people would have a pretty good idea of who I was and what I was trying to do, if I suddenly broke contact and moved to the mountains. But no, I hope to potter along making games, most of which will be pretty unpopular.</p><p><strong>DY:</strong> I plan on staying in games for a long time, but I understand wanting to dissociate from the industry at times. I try to only read and interact with the parts of gaming that are positive for me mentally. I realize that I&apos;m fortunate to be able to do so&#x2014;not everyone has that luxury. A baffling legacy sounds awesome, though!</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p>The You Testament, by MDickie</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>What are some other B-games you think are interesting?</strong></p><p><strong>BF:</strong> I think the other god of B-game development from Jazzuo&apos;s period is MDickie, whose magnum opus is <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/crap-shoot-the-you-testamen\" target=\"_blank\">The You Testament</a>, a game about Jesus. Other than that, well&#x2026; B-game is a pretty loosely defined term, which blends into other groupings like &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusoge\" target=\"_blank\">kusoge</a>&quot;, and I think the heart of it is games that are deliberately unpolished. I love Pajitnov and Pokhilko&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/magnetic-crane\" target=\"_blank\">Magnetic Crane</a> from 1989, but it predates developers who thought of themselves as making B-games. I like that Cactus game <a href=\"http://cactusquid.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/dungeon.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dungeon</a>, and Messhof&apos;s game <a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/messhof/You-Found-The-Grappling-Hook\" target=\"_blank\">You Found the Grappling Hook</a>. I love the Japanese B-Game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMIwpFwZCN8\" target=\"_blank\">Super Panda Ball</a>, kind of like a B-game version of Zany Golf. And I guess even though it costs money, we could also count Justin Smith&apos;s <a href=\"https://captaingames.itch.io/rsss\" target=\"_blank\">Realistic Summer Sports Simulator</a>, one of my favorite games of all time.</p><p><strong>DY:</strong> I highly recommend checking out the work of Ikiki, MDickie, and thecatamites. If I had to pick a game from each to try first, it would be <a href=\"https://www.tigsource.com/2007/06/11/nikujin/\" target=\"_blank\">Nikujin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mdickie.com/prev_hardtime.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hard Time</a>, and <a href=\"https://gamejolt.com/games/space-funeral/3492\" target=\"_blank\">Space Funeral</a>, respectively.

Every Saturday, we ask our panel of PC Gamer writers a question about PC gaming. Tim&apos;s answer is usually &apos;Hearthstone&apos;. This week: <strong>which game would you take to a desert island?</strong></p><p>Shout out to the enjoyable podcast <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/finalgamespodcast\" target=\"_blank\">Final Games</a>, which asks this very question to guests every episode (which have included PCG&apos;s Andy Kelly and Samuel Roberts in the past), allowing them to pick six games. Here, though, we&apos;ve just limited the selection to one game.&#xA0;</p><p>As ever, we&apos;d love to hear your suggestions in the comments, too.</p>\n<h3>Tim Clark: The Orange Box</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&apos;ve resisted the temptation to draw Samuel&apos;s ire by answering Hearthstone <em>again</em>, but I am going to assume the island has a working internet connection and pick The Orange Box. Between the infinite replayability, the sheer joy of Portal, and the no small matter of Episodes 1 and 2, I&apos;m pretty sure I win on pure value.&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Jarred Walton: Game Maker Studio/Unity Engine</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Game? How about software? Depending on how ambitious I&apos;m feeling, I&apos;d take either Unity Engine or Game Maker Studio. Then, as I basked in the sun waiting for rescue for the next several years, I could finally see about getting around to building my magnum opus. And let&apos;s assume I have all the necessary tools for doing graphics, sound, etc. and that infinite power is available.</p><p>The game would be something cyberpunk, but the great thing about having a software development platform is that I wouldn&apos;t need to create just one game. I could dabble in all sorts of genres and make as many games as I wanted&#x2014;or at least, as many as I had time to create before I was rescued, brought back to humanity, and became an instant millionaire with my wildly successful first indie release. Don&apos;t pinch me, I&apos;m enjoying my dreams.</p>\n<h3>Jody Macgregor: Stardew Valley</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is it weird to bring a game about growing food to an island where I&apos;ll be growing food to survive? Stardew Valley could be useful, reminding me when it&apos;s a good time to plant turnips or whatever. Plus, since I assume there&apos;s no wi-fi on this island, I&apos;d be able to experience it properly. I came to Stardew Valley late so there was already a wiki full of advice on what gifts to give people and where they hang out at any time of day, which spoiled it a bit for me. I never had that experience of waiting outside somebody&apos;s door all day just to give them a fish they&apos;d asked for.</p><p>Mostly I&apos;d bring Stardew Valley because it would make me less lonely. That virtual village of people would be better substitute friends than a ball with a face on it. Spending time with them makes me genuinely happy. Just filling my dog&apos;s bowl, harvesting some crops and walking into town to check in with people lifts my spirits, straight-up sunshine injected into my heart. The only other game that improves my mood as surely as Stardew Valley is Blood Bowl, a game about football and murder, but let&apos;s gloss over that.</p>\n<h3>Andy Kelly: The Witcher 3 and all the DLC</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If I&apos;m trapped on a desert island, escapism is going to be important. So I&apos;d take The Witcher 3 and all the DLC. That&apos;s a game you can get lost in, and it&apos;s so impossibly huge that by the time I&apos;ve finished it I&apos;ll have forgotten most of it, making it feel fresh when I start all over again.</p><p>And when I&apos;ve absolutely exhausted the storyline and know every quest by heart, I can just focus on getting really good at Gwent. Maybe set myself a goal like beating every single Gwent-playing NPC in the Northern Kingdoms or collecting every card. That should rinse through a few years.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Wes Fenlon: Spelunky</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&apos;m just going to be honest: the only way I&apos;d ever complete a Hell run in Spelunky is if I was trapped on a desert island with nothing to do but play Spelunky. Instead of telling you again why it&apos;s incredible, I&apos;ll just refer you to its #10 ranking on this year&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-games/10/\" target=\"_blank\">Top 100</a>, and its well-deserved <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/game-of-the-year-2013-spelunky/\" target=\"_blank\">Game of the Year 2013 award</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Chris Livingston: Crusader Kings 2</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Really, even in casual dabblings with CK2, there&apos;s always something interesting happening, some curious and enjoyable little stories bubbling to the surface, some random events throwing a medieval wrench into the works, some massive battle or minor yet incredibly personal beef occupying your attention. Every session of CK2 feels completely different, even with the same starting country and scenario. If I can bring some of the full conversion mods along too, I&apos;ll never be wanting for great new stories and long-lasting memories. And I play for a few years solid with no interruptions, maybe one day I&apos;ll be so on top of things that my character won&apos;t be over their demesne limit.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Austin Wood: Dungeons of Dredmor</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was having trouble with this one until Wes answered Spelunky. Which reminded me that, despite countless runs, I&apos;ve never actually reached the bottom of Dungeons of Dredmor and killed Dredmor himself. A trip to a desert island would give me time to finish things once and for all. Plus if I can finagle mod support, or at least download the DLC, I may still never see everything the dungeon has to offer.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Samuel Roberts: Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&apos;m half-tempted to pick an MMO I&apos;ve never had time for, like The Old Republic or Guild Wars 2, but if I&apos;m being honest with myself, MGS5 is the one. Missions play out differently each time, and the more hours you invest, the more tools you unlock to mess around with the enemies and their surrounding environment. Reaching S-rank on every mission would consume plenty of time, and while island life would be lonely, I could always pat D-Dog if it all gets a bit much.</p><p><em>But what about you, kind reader?

Or at least, it is if you forget that the 2012 version shipped with a deathmatch mode. Not many people talk about Spelunky deathmatch, in which up to four players brawl on a single-screen arena, using bombs and ropes and shotguns and rocks to pound the ever loving spe-lunk out of each other. It&apos;s adventure mode&apos;s weird, less-popular friend.</p><p>I think I understand why: If you dip into the mode solo using the default settings, you&#x2019;re fending off three erratic AI opponents, in addition to a laser target which roams the screen smiting anyone who stays still for too long. Oh, and the ghost: the dreaded ghost from the adventure mode turns up as well, so the whole thing just feels like a frantic mess to most newcomers. You&#x2019;ll likely die within three seconds of spawning (no exaggeration) and then you&#x2019;ll likely quit the mode three seconds later. It&#x2019;s about as bad as a first impression can get.&#xA0;</p><p>But for the last two years at least, Spelunky deathmatch has been my bread and butter. I&#x2019;ve played Nidhogg, Towerfall: Ascension, Sportsfriends, Videoball&#x2026; and none of them are as good a couch multiplayer game. You may believe Spelunky&#x2019;s finely wrought roguelike adventure mode was the modern classic, but nope: deathmatch is up there with it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>Turn off ghosts, turn off targets, turn off bots. Never, ever use bots. </p><figcaption><cite></cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>\n<p>The first step to enjoying Spelunky deathmatch is to ignore its default settings. They&#x2019;re crap. Turn off ghosts, turn off targets, turn off bots. Never, ever use bots. Then increase the amount of lives per match to 10. Then, increase each player&#x2019;s bomb amount to 10 (just do it). Now you&#x2019;ve got at least one perfect deathmatch game, but you might find other settings that work better for you.</p><p>The best thing about deathmatch Spelunky is that it inherits all of the complexity of its more popular sibling, while also demanding speed and reflexes the likes of which are rarely needed in adventure mode. For example, most adventure mode players know you can whip bombs to carefully nudge them into awkward places with more accuracy, but did you know you can whip <em>away</em> airborne bombs that have been lobbed at you? It&#x2019;s tricky, but you can and you&#x2019;ll need to, because being stunned is a death sentence.&#xA0;</p><p>Other tricks you might not use often in adventure mode become crucial in deathmatch, too: for example, learning to lob bombs with precision as an offensive attack, or just as a means to stun an opponent. Bombs are less tools of navigation and more automatic grenade launchers, and learning to predict their bounce patterns and trajectories is one of the first hard lessons you&#x2019;ll receive&#x2014;especially if your opponent has lobbed 10 at once.&#xA0;</p><p>Elsewhere, ropes are surefire ways to stun opponents from below; the teleporter is a neat portable telefragging device; and learning the maps and the best positions from which to lob bombs becomes more important than mere dexterity. Meanwhile, obscure items from the main game such as the shield&#x2014;only found in a single hidden area in adventure mode&#x2014;become powerful tactical tools in the deathmatch setting. Lessons that couldn&#x2019;t vaguely apply to adventure mode (except map learning, of course) compose the moment-to-moment stouches in deathmatch, where having the baseball gloves, a jar of sticky glue and a full inventory of bombs can prove disastrous to your opponent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>I want Spelunky deathmatch to be an esport. I want it to be on ESPN. It would make the world nicer.</p><figcaption><cite></cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>\n<p>Will the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/spelunky-2-is-coming-and-has-a-new-main-character/\" target=\"_blank\">newly announced Spelunky </a>2 have a deathmatch mode? No idea, but I hope so. I wouldn&#x2019;t blame creator Derek Yu and co for leaving it out, since it gained no traction in the original, but I reckon even the existing deathmatch mode could have its fate reversed just with a few tweaks to its default settings. There&#x2019;s so much potential, and if it had online support that would be a dream. I want Spelunky deathmatch to be an esport. I want it to be on ESPN. It would make the world nicer.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s assume for a moment that Spelunky 2 deathmatch exists: how can it improve upon the original? Aside from the obvious tweaks to its default game settings, I&#x2019;d definitely include a level editor, and I&#x2019;d be careful to remove items that are utterly useless in the mode (such as the parachute, as none of the maps are high enough to permit fall damage). Player spawns can also be a bit uneven and unfair, especially with four-players. Of course, we don&apos;t really know anything about Spelunky 2&#x2014;its weapons, items, and so on&#x2014;so apart from those elementary changes, it&#x2019;s hard to guess at what else might be done.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even Yu thought deathmatch was underrated, though he admitted he and co-creator Andy Hull were to blame. &#x201C;I think it was because people just didn&#x2019;t play it the way Andy and I did while we were developing it, where it was just much more tactical,&#x201D; he <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/derek-yu-on-the-state-of-indie-and-his-new-book-about-spelunky/2/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>told me last year</u></a>. &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t chuck bombs all over the place, we&#x2019;d wait for that perfect opportunity and try to take out the person when they were vulnerable.&quot;</p><p>&#x201C;I definitely don&#x2019;t blame the players or anything like that,&quot; he added. &quot;I think a lot of people do have a lot of fun with it, as a more casual thing. It may also be that adventure mode is more compelling than deathmatch mode.&#x201D;</p><p>No, it&#x2019;s not Derek. And while I&#x2019;m at it, chucking bombs all over the place is totally a viable strategy.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1509466344,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":239350}],"count":90}}
