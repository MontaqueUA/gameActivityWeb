Ahead of the update’s release, we want to announce we’ll be introducing a big community request: A third ability slot! Abilities will now be categorized into three groups: Offensive, Support, and Movement.\n\nSeptember 6-8: Players will be able to selectively Forge Offensive and Support Abilities at the Forge. Since each Class only has one Offensive and two Support Abilities, when Forging either of these slots, the pool of Abilities will include neutral and other Class’ Abilities. Movement Ability Forging will still only provide Movement Abilities for your Class.\n\nSeptember 13-15: Players will be able to selectively Forge Class- and Neutral-Offhand Abilities at the Forge. This means you will be able to choose to craft one of your three Class-Offhand Abilities (similar to the existing Forge Ability feature), or craft one ability that is not tied to a specific Class (Barricade, Turret, etc). In this context, “offhand” refers to Abilities that are not Movement Abilities.\n\nPlease join us on the Steam PTS to help test this new system for OB22’s release in early October! Following feedback, we will work alongside the community to figure out which system works best for players. For instructions on downloading the Steam PTS, see the diagram below.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/32920656/afab5d9fcb41b2760c181f620e00e7db5ab09d2d.gif[/img]","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567709302,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":813820},{"gid":"2412160539861717714","title":"Cute But Deadly Pack","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2412160539861717714","is_external_url":true,"author":"HeroicLeapJNash","contents":"[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/290ee3d2dfb30595d3bf69c4dc91ff764ebbd128.jpg[/img]\r\nLooks can be deceiving in Realm Royale’s newest DLC!

In Realm Royale, you’ll utilize both weapons and abilities to conquer the Realm and be the last player standing. When you dive into the Realm, you’ll be faced with many new and exciting gameplay elements that make the world unique. Let’s discuss some of the key factors to getting started in Realm Royale.\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/4663291a8f6231f594eaf7d358bfdf7060377dc2.png[/img][h1]Realm Royale is a class-based battle royale[/h1]\r\nWhen you start a match, you will select one of four Classes: Warrior, Hunter, Assassin, and Mage. Each Class has its own unique advantages with weapons and abilities you’ll find throughout the Realm. While players can use any of the items they find as they explore the world, each Class will have weapons and abilities that help support each Class’ role within the game. A Warrior, for instance, specializes in charging into battle wielding Axes and Hammers, where a Hunter may use its dodging prowess and mastery of the bow to gain the upper hand in combat. Mastering each class and its advantageous abilities are key to claiming the Crown Royale.\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/fffb3cbeaae7f2d1b2d3c41519f5560e2ef110f1.jpg[/img][h1]You’ll use weapons and abilities in combat[/h1]\r\nRealm Royale offers many unique combat interactions through its inclusion of weapons and abilities. Each player may hold two weapons, ranging from standard weaponry like Assault Rifles and Shotguns, to exotic weapons like Throwing Axes and Longbows. While any class can fare well with the standard weaponry, each class will have certain advantages with specific weapons and abilities. For example, an Assassin will gain Cooldown bonuses to abilities like Hidden, which serves as a means to remain stealthy and gain an advantageous angle on your opponents.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of abilities: basic abilities and movement abilities. Basic abilities will offer active offensive and defensive actions to take in combat to help defeat your foes. Movement abilities will allow you to travel, escape, or surprise your enemies. Each Class begins with a movement ability, but you are free to use whichever ability you find while looting!\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/bd979c0d3753fab6f60c2b1d194681623234be5e.jpg[/img][h1]In Realm Royale, you may be down, but you’re not out[/h1]\r\nWhen your health reaches zero, you’re not out of the game, at least not if you know how to escape your foes as a Chicken! If you survive long enough as a Chicken, you’ll be back in the action and ready to seek revenge. Learning to maneuver as a chicken will keep you in the game longer!\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/849c14cc1c424d2c9099c1b862f3ca32a81d466c.png[/img][h1]Mount up to traverse the Realm[/h1]\r\nIn Realm Royale, you can use your Mount for quick transportation between points of interest. There are vast sandy deserts, frigid mountains, an iridescent mushroom forest, and many more areas for you to explore - use your mount to explore the Realm and find the loot to best suit your playstyle.\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/5bbee66fbc8fad00b976875d037e455135b6e291.png[/img][h1]Forge items to get ahead[/h1]\r\nWhile exploring the Realm, you’ll discover Forges scattered throughout the map that allow you to craft Legendary Weapons, Combat and Mobility Abilities, and Healing Potions. Of course, crafting doesn’t come without a price! As you find items you don’t want to use, you can disenchant items to accrue Shards, the currency you need to craft gear at the Forge.\r\n\r\nOnce a Forge becomes active, it will make a fair amount of noise and billow out smoke, alerting nearby players that something is being made. Be ready to defend your well earned items, or take advantage of the situation to lay a trap for your opponents!\r\n\r\nEach Forge can only craft each type of item once per match, so consider carefully which items to make to propel yourself to victory. Fortunately with your trusty steed, you can visit multiple Forges in a game to craft the items you’ll need as you explore.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Forge allows players to craft Resurrection Scrolls, which will bring eliminated teammates back to life! This comes with a hefty Shard cost, but it may be worth it to bring your friends back into the fight.\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/8d061b79dfdf546a4e2e5d5321d7fc9d6c5f526d.png[/img][h1]Customize your gameplay with Talents[/h1]\r\nEach Class has a Talent System, allowing you to further customize your gameplay experience to match your preferences and playstyles. Each class starts with 10 Talents unlocked, providing passive bonuses to general stats, the weapons and abilities you use in combat, and which items you will craft at the Forge.\r\n\r\nAs you level up with a Class by playing, you will unlock additional Talent options for each of the 10 Talent slots. Select your Talents carefully to build upon your preferred playstyle: if you have a preferred weapon or ability, there are many talents that offer you advantages to the weapons of your liking. For full details, see our [url=https://www.realmroyale.com/news/introducing-the-talent-system]Talent System blog[/url].\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/a5c4e6b6910d22dd59c7c5590c84f5105d0459ef.png[/img][h1]Loot extraordinary items from extraordinary sources[/h1]\r\nAs you make your way through the Realm, you may hear some snickering from unseen foes. These mischievous creatures have been collecting weapons and treasures of battles past. Find and defeat them to steal their loot! Loot Goblins don’t stick around for long, so you’ll need to defeat them quickly before they retreat back to their lairs.\r\n\r\nYou may also hear a Zeppelin overhead during a match. Follow it closely, as they will drop Legendary Chests containing Epic and Legendary Weapons, Abilities, and Runes! Legendary Chests and Goblins can drop items found nowhere else in the Realm, so they may be worth the risk to pursue.\r\n\r\n[h1]Have more questions?

While this update won’t cover all of the things we’re working on, we want to share some of the big ticket items we are actively developing.\r\n\r\nThe team is constantly working to make Realm Royale better through new features and polish / improvements. However, our current development cycle has not allowed our team to deliver an acceptable amount of polish to the game. Our rapid pace often results in the team needing to spend a substantial amount of time cleaning up issues from previous updates, rather than fixing issues before they reach the live servers. This has impacted our ability to focus on polish, and add new content.\r\n\r\nFollowing the OB20 update, Realm Royale will move from a 4-week update cycle to a 6-week update cycle, allowing us to include exciting content with each major update (like the examples noted below). Smaller patches and hotfixes may come out between these updates to allow us to fix bugs or to address critical balance concerns. This change will allow us to better test content and will help us to ensure a higher quality release with each update.\r\n\r\nRoughly every 12 weeks, we will continue to introduce new Battle Passes, each with its own unique theme and cosmetics. Player progression is an important part of creating a fun experience, and we’re committed to continue offering high-quality cosmetics for players to unlock throughout the year.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to a great year of updates for Realm Royale and are thrilled to take this journey with you. With each update, we will work to balance player requests and community ideas with features that the development team would add to the game experience, as we want to build Realm Royale alongside our community. Below, we’ve included a number of features and updates we will be making to Realm Royale throughout the Eternal Conflict Battle Pass.\r\n [h1]New Heavy Weapon and Weapon Balance[/h1]\r\nA number of weapons are under review by the team to ensure that they are fitting their target roles and performing as well as we believe they should. Some weapons, like the Slug Rifle, are consistently powerful at all ranges, while others like the Assault Rifle are struggling to find their identity. The team is looking to review all existing weapons and introduce new weapons later this year to ensure that Realm Royale’s guns are the right power level, unique, and most importantly, fun to use.\r\n [h1]New Abilities[/h1]\r\nThroughout the year, we are looking to introduce new abilities. For starters: We’re looking forward to introducing a new ability during our next Battle Pass this Summer. The team is also reviewing many of the movement abilities for later this year.\r\n [h1]Custom Lobbies[/h1]\r\nAs a battle royale, Realm Royale has fostered a strong competitive appetite within the community. Within the next few updates, we are looking to introduce the functionality for players to host their own private matches. We hope to add the ability to customize the in-game experience in the future.\r\n [h1]Map Updates[/h1]\r\nOne of Realm Royale’s most unique features is its map. With changes to Ice Haven, Crossing, Guntown, and Jade Gardens already this year, we’re committed to updating the map to keep the Realm interesting and unique in your travels. This year players can expect to see further changes to points of interest around the map, as well as improvements to add flavor to the open world.\r\n [h1]Chicken Combat[/h1]\r\nEver been so close to defeating your foe you could practically taste it? The team is developing a system for the battle to continue once you’re chickened. While dealing a relatively small amount of damage, Chickens will be able to attack other players to allow you to buck up and finish off weakened foes.\r\n\r\nBe sure to follow us on [url=http://twitter.com/RealmRoyale]Twitter[/url] and visit our [url=http://facebook.com/RealmRoyale]Facebook[/url] page to stay up to date with new announcements, information on when updates will arrive, and more.

all Realm Royale content creators and community groups: The Realm Royale Partner Program is now online! Established members and groups in the Realm Royale community can now receive support for their content.\r\n\r\nWondering if you have what it takes? Check the minimum requirements on [url=https://www.realmroyale.com/partner]our website[/url] to determine your eligibility. We will then evaluate your content to see if you’re a good fit to be a brand representative.\r\n\r\nBeing a partner comes with its own unique benefits, ranging from free Crowns to features on social media. Plus: you’ll get giveaway codes to reward your own awesome communities!\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the Realm Royale Partner Program, we are also ending our near 24-hour uptime on the official Realm Royale Twitch and Mixer channels. We want to ensure that we are offering all content creators and partners opportunities to grow their own channels. We will continue to work with the content creators that were featured on the channel, and you can find them playing Realm Royale on their own channels on Twitch and Mixer!\r\n\r\nWhile we review the official channels’ presence on Twitch and Mixer, the channel will only be used for official broadcasts such as update shows and tournament for the time being. Should future opportunities arise for content creators, we will reach out to some of our most active content creators directly!\r\n\r\nWe look forward to reviewing your applications! Show us your best content and we’ll be in touch!\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1554926434,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":813820},{"gid":"2508976515662021572","title":"The Starter Pack is Now Available!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2508976515662021572","is_external_url":true,"author":"HeroicLeapJNash","contents":"[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32920656/68e067b4ce32c3d4315d66932eadb54f49ac9d39.jpg[/img]\r\nIntroducing a brand new bundle to Realm Royale: The Starter Pack!
