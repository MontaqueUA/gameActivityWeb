Channelling the best bits of Avatar: The Last Airbender, it sold the fantasy of being a kung-fu wizard through exacting, frantic combat. My only real gripe with <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/05/15/wizard-of-legend-review/\">it in my review here</a> was that there just wasn&#8217;t enough of it. Today, developers Contingent99 addressed that, adding a bit more of everything to the arcade dungeon crawl, completely free. It now now features a wind-themed dungeon and corresponding arch-mage to fight, new spells to sling, new enemies to use them on, and an endless survival mode.

But in case you missed it, be sure to check out the teaser trailer for the update [url=https://youtu.be/DWm1wPDf0-w][b]here[/b][/url]!\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing we’d like to address is that we’re expecting the Sky Palace to launch in the early months of 2019 rather than at the end of this year as initially planned. We’re still in the process of putting the finishing touches on the update and we can’t thank you enough for your support thus far. The game will be automatically updated when the Sky Palace goes live.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/ipSvlzV.gif[/img]\r\nThe first thing we’ll be showing off is the often requested Endless Run mode!\r\nOnce you’ve cleared the chaos trials, you’ll find that a very mysterious old man begins to show up towards the end of the trials. This old man will allow you to spend some of your hard earned chaos gems to loop to the beginning of the trials with all the powerful artifacts you’ve collected on the way. However, upon looping to the beginning of the trials, you’ll find that things aren’t quite as rosy as you remember them being as all enemies will be significantly more difficult! But if you can survive, you just may be able to become the perfect wizard that you always dreamed of becoming!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/wrHQ7sR.gif[/img]\r\nAlso, Nox the Unfortunate has now set up his cursed relic shop in Lanova Plaza. Though they’ll come at a steep price, these relics will be a bit more powerful than the standard curses and will drastically affect the trials as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of course, with every update, we’ll be adding new content in the form of arcana, relics, capes, enemies, and rooms to the game! While there are quite a few changes, here’s a quick sneak peek at two new signature arcana being added in the update:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/0ZVF2Wo.gif[/img]\r\nWhile we’ve gone back and given several of the original arcana new signature versions, Tectonic drill is a favorite of ours! In its signature version, wizards fire off a barrage of miniature drills before following up with a massive drill of gigantic proportions!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/vzsDCMW.gif[/img]\r\nThe second signature is a new arcana added in this update, [b]Dragon Surge[/b]! This arcana fires off watery dragons that swim around the stage while torpedoing through enemies to disrupt them!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s all for this update! Thank you again for your awesome support and we’ll do our best to get the Sky Palace update out as soon as possible!\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays!\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1544230882,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":445980},{"gid":"2447032995766375048","title":"Daily Deal - Wizard of Legend, 20% Off","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/news/43619/","is_external_url":false,"author":"Valve","contents":"Today's Deal: Save 20% on <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/'>Wizard of Legend</a>!*<br><br>Look for the deals each day on the front page of Steam.

It&apos;s an isometric dungeon crawler about clearing out procedurally generated labyrinths using elemental spells ranging from fists of flame and exploding boulders to ice spears and good old-fashioned lightning bolts. You play as an up-and-coming battlemage, and to make your mark in the world of wizardry, you&apos;ve got to overcome the Chaos Trials and beat the masters of earth, water, and fire, not to mention all the monsters and mini-bosses in the floors between them. I&apos;ve failed a few dozen times already, but I&apos;m making steady progress, and the fast-paced, combo-driven combat keeps me coming back.</p><p>You&apos;re going to want to play Wizard of Legend with a controller. It feels a lot like a 2D brawler: you&apos;ve got a basic melee attack, a dodge, and two to four flashy spells, one of which doubles as your ultimate, which is charged by racking up hits. Oddly enough, there&apos;s no mana in Wizard of Legend. Instead, all spells operate on cooldowns. Your melee attacks have no cooldown, but stronger spells can take up to 10 seconds to recharge. This makes it easy to experiment with new and different spells, but you still have to use your best ones carefully. There&apos;s nothing worse than strolling up to a perfectly clustered group of enemies, reaching for your trusty AoE, realizing it&apos;s still on cooldown, and getting dogpiled as you frantically backpedal.</p>\n<p>You start every run with your melee, your dodge, and two spells. You set up this core loadout beforehand, and then you can purchase new spells, or upgrades for your current spells, mid-dungeon using the gold you earn by defeating enemies. However, apart from the spells you receive for defeating elemental masters, you don&apos;t keep the spells you unlock in dungeons when you die. You also lose all your gold on death. To permanently unlock spells, you need to earn chaos gems, which you can spend on new stat-boosting robes and relics, as well as new spells, back at the hub. You&apos;ll get a few chaos gems from basic enemies, but the masters and minibosses are the biggest sources. Luckily, you don&apos;t lose your gems when you die, so you&apos;re always making progress.&#xA0;</p><p>This split gold-gem economy is one of my favorite things about Wizard of Legend, because for me, cumulative progress is an essential part of a good roguelike. I want to know that with every failed run I&apos;m not only getting better at the game, I&apos;m also unlocking stuff that I can use in future runs. In the case of Wizard of Legend, each run feels different because of the spells and relics I purchase using gold, but at the same time I&apos;m earning permanent upgrades through gems. I can try a new spell in the labyrinth, then if I like it, I can purchase it with gems and put it in my starting loadout. I can use what I learn to improve my strategies <em>and </em>expand my arsenal, which is what makes Wizard of Legend so compelling. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>It helps that the spells are a delight to discover and use. I&apos;ve encountered five of six elements so far&#x2014;earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning&#x2014;and there&apos;s a ton of variety between them. I started off with a mix of wind and ice spells: a quick three-jab wind melee, a breezy dash which damages enemies I move through, a spread of icicles thrown in a wide arc, and surging glaciers which travel in a straight line (and bounce around the room when my ult is charged). Then I discovered the Blazing Lariat, a circular AoE which wrecks shit like late-night Mexican food. After that fateful encounter, I started using fire spells like small homing fireballs and, of course, one big-ol&apos; classic fireball.&#xA0;</p><p>Before long, I was a full-fledged avatar, stunning foes with lightning, pummeling them with boulders, pinning them to walls with ice spears, blasting them into pits with tornadoes, and reducing them to ashes with all manner of fireballs. Using multiple elements is generally the way to go because it lets you exploit enemy weaknesses. Elements have a rock-paper-scissors thing going on, meaning certain elements are strong against, and weak to, certain elements. Each elemental master is preceded by two dungeon floors, and the enemies on those floors share their master&apos;s element. In other words, if you&apos;ve got nothing but fire spells, you&apos;ll blast through the earth floors, but you&apos;ll also struggle on ice and fire floors.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>After a few painfully short runs, I also learned to make better use of robes and relics. I was constantly struggling with healing in the early stages, but once I unlocked a robe that increases my critical hit chance and a relic that heals me on crit, I was able to dive deeper than ever. I&apos;ve beaten all three elemental masters individually, but I&apos;ve yet to beat them all in one go. The order you fight them in changes every run, and the deeper they are, the harder they get. The earth master, for instance, uses different and faster attacks when you fight him on the second floor, making for a similar but tougher fight. I shudder to think what a third-floor ice master is like. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll find out, because I&apos;m not going to uninstall Wizard of Legend anytime soon.

No fate-of-the-world stuff here, just mystical showboating.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/05/15/wizard-of-legend-review/#more-543327\" class=\"more-link\">(more&hellip;)</a></p>\n","feedlabel":"Rock, Paper, Shotgun","date":1526409047,"feedname":"rps","feed_type":0,"appid":445980},{"gid":"3822871998328372608","title":"Wizard of Legend is Available Now!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/3822871998328372608","is_external_url":true,"author":"Contingent99","contents":"[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/][img]https://i.imgur.com/8aEWnfE.png[/img][/url]\r\nhttps://youtu.be/W6SmZKxO_Jw\r\n\r\n[h1]Wizard of Legend is available now!
