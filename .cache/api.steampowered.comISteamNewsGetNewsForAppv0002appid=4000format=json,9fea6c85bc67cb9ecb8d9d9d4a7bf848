No more broken sounds and effects.\r\n\r\nWe have also added better NPC support to scripted weapons, so addon makers can now control exactly how the NPCs can use their weapons. As an example, the built-in Flechette Gun now has full NPC support, meaning it can be picked up by Citizens/Rebels from the ground and used properly against their enemies.\r\n\r\nYour in-game content such as Dupes (built-in, not modded), Saves, Spawnlists, etc now also saves on the Steam Cloud automatically. This feature was enabled a few weeks ago, but we are mentioning it here so you are aware. There is a hard limit of 10000 files per account for this, so be careful if you have excessive amounts of saves and whatnot, if you reach the limit, your new content will not be saved on the Steam Cloud until you delete some old stuff first.\r\n\r\nThere has also been some improvements to CS:GO/Left 4 Dead map support, fixing some flickering models around those maps and fixing unexpected water effects in certain places on some CS:GO maps.\r\n\r\nThe Half-Life campaign support continues to improve, as level transitions now work properly in singleplayer, Jeeps get their Gauss Guns back in Half-Life 2 maps, the Half-Life 2 teleporter sequence now slows down the player properly, added a new feature to limit player's ammo (with the ability to match Half-Life defaults) and the suit chargers were changed back to restore 75 armor by default just like in Half-Life 2.\r\n\r\nYou will find the complete list of changes for this update at the link below.\r\n\r\n[url=https://gmod.facepunch.com/blog/september-2019-update]View Update Post[/url]\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567526406,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":4000},{"gid":"2416665403774035656","title":"September 2019 Update is coming soon","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2416665403774035656","is_external_url":true,"author":"Rubat","contents":"Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nIt's that time again, another update coming soon!\r\nThe current plan is to release the next Garry's Mod update on 3rd of September around the usual 4PM GMT.\r\n\r\nYou can find the list of changes that will be coming here:\r\nhttp://wiki.garrysmod.com/changelist/prerelease/\r\n\r\n[h1]Help us test the update[/h1]\r\nWe kindly ask anyone willing to help us test this update before it releases (especially modders and server owners), to minimize any potential problems with the update.\r\n\r\nYou will find instructions on how to use the upcoming update below.\r\n\r\nYou can report any found issues in the comments below, or on our official bug tracking repository on GitHub: ( be sure to search before posting )\r\nhttps://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues\r\n\r\n[h1]Pre-release Steam Branch[/h1]\r\nThe Pre-Release Steam branch for Garry's Mod has been updated and contains all the changes that will be included in the next update. \r\n\r\nIf you want to set up an Dedicated Server instance using the Pre-Release branch, see this article: https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Hosting_A_Dedicated_Server.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]How to switch game branches:[/b]\r\n[olist]\r\n    [*]Exit the game\r\n    [*]Right click on [b]Garry's Mod[/b] in Steam and select [b]Properties[/b]\r\n    [*]Go to the [b]Betas[/b] tab and select your desired branch\r\n[/olist]\r\n[b]None[/b] - This is the normal version of the game\r\n[b]Pre-Release[/b] - This is the next update\r\n[b]Dev[/b] - This is a bleeding edge version of the game, expect it to contain more bugs than usual\r\n[/quote]\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1566585634,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":4000},{"gid":"2436926440585393310","title":"July 2019 Update is live!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2436926440585393310","is_external_url":true,"author":"Rubat","contents":"[url=https://gmod.facepunch.com/blog/july-2019-update][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/779601233486993906/A9ABA91036DD5C04BC48E10EAEEC25D6790560AA/[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nArt by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1775160452]Nicnac[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Update Highlights[/h1]\r\nThis update finally brings the Half-Life: Source weapons and entities, which were added a few updates ago, directly to your Spawnmenu.\r\n\r\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/rubat/1b2811b1/hlsentsweps.png[/img]\r\n(Note that this requires Half-Life: Source owned and installed on Steam, as well as mounted in Garry's Mod)\r\n\r\nThis also means the weapons were given proper art pass treatment - third person animations, models and all effects included, which is why the weapons weren't available in the spawnmenu previously.\r\n\r\nIn addition a lot of Half-Life and NPC related changes and fixes are introduced in this update for your enjoyment. NPCs can now use more built-in weapons (.357 Magnum and Glock) and use others (RPG Launcher) more effectively, some progression stopping bugs in Half-Life campaigns have been resolved.\r\n\r\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive map support has been improved as well, static props now get their proper color and there is no longer any weird issues with Physics Gun and bullets hitting the air. The maps also are no longer extremely shiny.\r\n\r\nThe update also brings some general fixes and improvements to the game, including security, stability and minor performance improvements.\r\n\r\nNotable among Lua API changes and improvements is the addition of [url=https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/util/GetModelMeshes]util.GetModelMeshes[/url]. This new function will allow modders to modify existing models in ways not previously possible. This and all of other new Lua API additions and changes are documented on our [url=https://wiki.garrysmod.com]our Official Wiki[/url].\r\n\r\n[url=https://gmod.facepunch.com/blog/july-2019-update]View Post[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Sale[/h1]\r\nGarry's Mod is currently on sale at 75% off!\r\n\r\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/]Visit the Garry's Mod store page[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Notice[/h1]\r\n[quote]This update will require servers to update before you can join them.
