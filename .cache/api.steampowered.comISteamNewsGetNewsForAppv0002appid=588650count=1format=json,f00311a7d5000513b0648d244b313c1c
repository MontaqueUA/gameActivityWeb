The 'of War' may be no more, but the thick necks and bug mangling are still present and correct - and Xbox One and PC Game Pass subscribers will be able to see how developer The Coalition has fared on Friday, 6th September.</p><p>Before that, however, Motion Twin's exquisite action-platform rogue-like Dead Cells joins the Game Pass library tomorrow, 5th September, on Xbox One. It's coming to PC this month too but - and you'll soon spot a theme here - there's no release date on the platform at present. Metal Gear Solid HD Edition: 2 &amp; 3 also arrives on the 5th, but that's Xbox One only.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-04-septembers-xbox-game-pass-games-include-gear-5-dead-cells-enter-the-gungeon\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1567624500,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":311690}],"count":141}}
