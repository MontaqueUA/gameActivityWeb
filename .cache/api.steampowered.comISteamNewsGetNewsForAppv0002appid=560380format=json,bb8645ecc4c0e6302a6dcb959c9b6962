Our team decided that with LAMBCOOK’s official departure from MapleStory 2, that I’d write a few blog posts until Producer Nimei returns to the office from her maternity leave in October.\r\n\r\nThis year has been a bit of a roller coaster so far, hasn’t it? We’ve had our high points and our low points, but for the most part I’m immensely proud of how far the game has come. If you ever get an opportunity to work in this kind of industry, I’m sure you’ll be surprised to see how deep the logistics go when it comes to localizing and developing unique features and systems for an existing game.\r\n\r\nWe’re approaching the final quarter of 2019, and with that, we’re also starting to approach the first year anniversary for MapleStory 2, as well as the [b]next major expansion[/b] for the game, which will arrive [b]before the end of this year[/b]!\r\n\r\n[b]Current Itinerary[/b]\r\n\r\nI want to recap some of the previous livestream as well, and discuss why the next update will come in September. While we technically could deploy an August content update, it would be hard to guarantee appropriate time to fix any critical bugs that could potentially appear. This includes updating the Style Crate, which would require us to patch the game as well. Meret Market updates, on the other hand, can be done without requiring a new patch for the game, so we’ll have a few additions to the Meret Market. Some of you may have seen a certain Pink and Beany friend make an appearance on our social media. You'll see our adorable friend in your local Meret Market come August 29th along with the other additions! The best part? You’ll be able to buy the emote separately no strings attached, for a mere 300 Blue Merets! Another choice addition you’ll see to the Meret Market are the hotly requested Fox Ears, which have eluded players for the longest time.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/ae5eb4134f9593594251c99d51c176307856a280.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNow, that all being said, the next update for MapleStory 2 will come in the [b]middle of September[/b] rather than at the end of the month. In addition to our best in-game events and sales yet, it’ll come with a slew of bug fixes and a few noteworthy quality of life improvements.\r\n\r\nWe will still have anniversary and holiday events, and you’ll find a myriad of useful and fun rewards from them (including a few, choice, scrolls of interest...).\r\n\r\n[b]In the Meantime...[/b]\r\n\r\nWhat of the month preceding, some of you may be wondering? You’ll have a few weeks between the end of August and the September update, and we are planning to run a few useful events for everyone. I won’t reveal all of them right now, but some of the ones we’ll be running include [b]extending the 25% weekend enchanting discount[/b], [b]doubling drops[/b] in all [b]level 60 Hard Adventure Dungeons (yes that includes Lapenshard fragments!)[/b], and [b]discounting furnishing[/b] in your houses by [b]50%[/b], all until the September update lands. These events will start near the end of this month.\r\n\r\n[b]In Closing[/b]\r\n\r\nWe have tried our best to keep you in the loop and be as transparent as possible with our proceedings, and we will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. We’re immensely thankful for our fans who continue to play and support the game, and hope that MapleStory 2 will continue to head in a good direction.\r\n\r\nWe’ll have more news to share as we come closer to September, so please stay tuned until then!\r\n\r\nFaithfully your CM,\r\nKyrios","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1566500415,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":560380},{"gid":"2412161173665412320","title":"Mix Master Mapler Pack","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2412161173665412320","is_external_url":true,"author":"CM Kyrios","contents":"[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/e2795f0e53024344451f262be6d2c484b80c6f5c.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAugust continues with a pair of new sales, including the new [b]Rejuvenating Weekly Style Pack[/b] and a [b]Mix Master Mapler Pack[/b] filled with fun club items!\r\n\r\n[b]Mix Master Mapler Pack[/b]\r\n\r\nGet the party started with this collection of DJ-themed items, including [b]Metal Headphones[/b], the [b]Mushy DJ Name Tag[/b] and [b]Chat Bubble[/b], and the brand-new [b]DJ Emote[/b]!\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/23638d403981c35e412184ee6354e95ae962f6ea.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Sale Duration[/b]:\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]UTC[/b]: 3:30 PM Thursday, August 15th -

Moreover, their Wind Focus, despite potentially being more powerful than their Fire Focus, felt very clunky to play due to animation locks. We boosted their damage a little bit so that they can even the playing field when facing down a single target, and improved the main attraction of the Wind Focus while also making Greater Sharp Eyes a more useful tool.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Flame Arrow's[/b] damage has been increased across the board ([b]8%[/b], [b]15%[/b], and [b]16%[/b] respectively per stage), and the damage of the three-arrow combo has been made constant, instead of being heavily front-loaded.

Please note that, despite rumors to the contrary, this skill is also affected by Attack Speed.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Assassin[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]Give me more Spirit! Assassin players have been suffering from issues of SP starvation for a very long time, which often led to a lot of memes about them. Needless to say, many of you commented that when the class works, it feels right. So, in an attempt to address the issue, we made a few cost adjustments. While these don't fully address the SP issue at its core, it should hopefully greatly alleviate the burden. Adjusting Redoubled Pain to be able to critical hit on it's main damage source will require careful monitoring to make sure it's not too powerful.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Redoubled Pain's[/b] SP cost has been reduced to [b]9 SP[/b] (from 11 SP).[/*]\r\n[*][b]Redoubled Pain[/b] can now score a [b]critical hit when consuming the poison[/b].[/*]\r\n[*][b]Binding Punishment's[/b] SP cost has been [b]reduced to 15 SP[/b] (from 20 SP).[/*]\r\n[*][b]Dark Mire's[/b] SP cost has been [b]reduced to 30 SP[/b] (from 40 SP).[/*]\r\n[*][b]Assassin's Circle[/b] can now score a [b]critical hit[/b].[/*]\r\n[*][b]Shadow Stance[/b] has gained [b]additional Dark Damage[/b].[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/f1f25c9ca70f43c7bed9de1558f6ba95a681c6a3.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Berserker[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]The Berserker's Bleed Focus is notoriously powerful for dealing super-fast damage, while being nearly indestructible thanks to the Raging Soul buff. We elected not to touch this skill tree at all and instead focus on the Swordplay Focus of Berserker, designed around slow but impactful hits. By slightly adjusting the cooldown of Aerial Smash it should seamlessly flow out of two cycles of Skull Splitter. Additionally, we're increasing the amount of power Blood Fury provides while also increasing its trigger threshold from 30% all the way up to 50%. That'll really let this focus excel in the second half of battles, rather than the last leg of the fight with dynamic Skull Splitter resets, Dark Aura resets, and powerful Bloodlust mini-nukes.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]The [b]physical attack bonus[/b] provided by [b]Blood Fury[/b] has been increased.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/cb0d61e3c00259546aefa100ffcf35bd0122f235.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Aerial Smash's[/b] cooldown has been reduced to [b]7 seconds[/b] (down from 8 seconds).[/*]\r\n[*][b]Blood Fury[/b] will now activate when striking a target [b]below 50% max HP[/b] (up from 30%).[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Heavy Gunner[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]Heavy Gunner has been in a solid spot in terms of ranged DPS, but the Plasma Focus was lacking due to a number of inhibiting problems that made it finicky to use. Some slight adjustments should make it more enjoyable to play while also centering the spotlight on the Plasma Focus' Sky Hunter, which may require additional attention later to make it less difficult to use. As Heavy Gunner is a DPS class with no utility, we will closely monitor to see if it needs additional improvements to get it where it should be compared to other classes.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Plasma Chain's[/b] explosion can now score a [b]critical hit[/b].[/*]\r\n[*][b]Sky Hunter's[/b] cooldown was reduced to [b]30 seconds[/b] (down from 60 seconds).[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Knight[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]When it came to the Knight, we felt like the class was already in a good place with damage in the Longsword Focus. However, halfway down the Shield Focus of the Job Rank II skills we felt like its ultimate skill, Heaven's Judgment, was far too weak. We've made some slight adjustments to damage and will come back to this skill branch later to see what else we can do to make it as appealing as the Sword Focus, but centered on support.

In order to make them more appealing, we've made slight adjustments to make their support a little better and more consistent, while also improving their Battle Focus so that multiple Priests can play together with far fewer drawbacks than how it is currently.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]The damage amplification provided by [b]Vitality[/b] has been increased.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/77b4f3477bc07f3858f1fb4fc9fb68951d663512.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Divine Wave's[/b] chance to activate additional damage as well as heal has been [b]increased to 25%[/b] (from 12%).[/*]\r\n[*]The bonus damage of [b]Light Sword[/b] can now score a [b]critical hit[/b].[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Runeblade[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]For Runeblade characters, its Rune Focus, the lesser known little brother of the Blade Focus, is often neglected.

Soul Binder will also receive the only nerf for this update, a decrease to the potency of Soul Cube, while also gaining the option for the shield to be similarly powerful by expending one of their Awakened Mantra. This skill was far too overpowered in its current state and made other classes' survivability issues obsolete.

I want to thank everyone who's tuning in to read the blog today, and I'd like to report back on the progress we've made up to now. Our upcoming [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update arrives next week and we hope it infuses some excitement! I'll go over the big ticket items of this update briefly, but rest assured there will be a lot more details shared via our event post and Patch Notes as usual.\r\n\r\nHere's the rundown of topics for today that are included in the [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Dungeon Helpers and More[/*]\r\n[*]Job Rank II Skill Rebalancing[/*]\r\n[*]Trader's Ribbon for Lv. 60 Equipment[/*]\r\n[*]Red Crystals for Pet Talent Changes[/*]\r\n[*]Maple Life Improvements[/*]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Meso House Assistants[/*]\r\n[*]Plot Purchase Price Reduction by 90%[/*]\r\n[*]New Housing Blocks from Community Requests[/*]\r\n[/list][*]And More![/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Dungeon Helper and More[/h1]\r\n\r\nAs the community has been discussing, we think there's more to be done to assist new players with settling into MapleStory 2. There have been some excellent community initiatives to do this, and we wanted to find a systematic way to reward players for doing good deeds with the Dungeon Helper system.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the Dungeon Helper system is designed to reward players who assist newbies. With this update, if you are a veteran who's played a specific dungeon more than 10 times, you can assist those who haven't cleared that goal and receive a token for your help. If you are a novice player who's played fewer than 10 times, you can click a button to get help and your request will be blasted out in world chat to summon your knight in shining armor!\r\n\r\nWe understand that this system won't function at its best if the rewards are not meaningful for you. With this token, you can purchase some of the most desired items in MapleStory 2. This includes not only the often discussed and requested Epic Accessory Attribute Lock Scrolls, but also Legendary scrolls and more. The Dungeon Helper system is now a designated permanent location for receiving these scrolls, and an exact list of potential rewards and prices will be detailed out in the [b]Skilled Ally[/b] Patch Notes, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\nWhile we hope the Dungeon Helper system will help new players grow, we also wanted to revisit the balance for Lv. 60 Hard Adventure Dungeons. Compared to the easy-to-follow Epic questlines, the Lv. 60 Hard Adventure Dungeons that follow right after come as a jarring experience as the difficulty ramps up significantly, as some players have pointed out. To put these dungeons more in line, we'll be lowering the HP of enemies by 25% for all Lv. 60 Hard Adventure Dungeons, and reducing damage from enemies by 30% for The Song of the Oracle and Guardian of the Seas.\r\n\r\n[h1]Job Rank II Skill Rebalancing[/h1]\r\n\r\nAs skills are one of the most discussed topics among players, we rounded up as much feedback as we could and went back to the drawing board with the development team to see if there were any changes we could make. We're happy to report that our first full pass of the Job Rank II Skill rebalance is done and ready to make its way into our [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update. The full list is pretty extensive, but all the final adjustments for each class will be fully detailed in the [b]Skilled Ally[/b] Patch Notes.\r\n\r\nOur focus at this time was to make the less popular skill trees of each class more interesting, giving you more of a choice in which tree to pursue. Please note that we had to be selective in choosing the changes we elected to make, in order to keep the overall balance of current meta while not jeopardizing future meta as well. By no means will this be our final adjustment of skills though, so please do let us know how they feel after you've experienced them.\r\n\r\n[h1]Trader's Ribbon for Lv. 60 Equipment[/h1]\r\n\r\nLv. 60 Epic and Legendary Equipment that came with the Awakening update can now be traded using Lv. 60 Trader's Ribbons. Similar to how Lv. 50 Trader's Ribbons worked, these new ribbons will be obtained from Dungeon Rank Boxes from Lv. 60 Chaos Raids / Eye of Lapenta.\r\n\r\nPlease note that only Dungeon Rank Reward Boxes obtained AFTER the [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update will contain the Trader's Ribbons. If you are planning to save your runs for the noted dungeons until then, we wouldn't advise it, since this means you will be saving runs for the entire week to be done in a couple of hours (assuming a quick and problem-free maintenance). That said, the choice is ultimately yours, and we wanted to make sure this was known for everyone today.\r\n\r\n[h1]Red Crystal for Pet Talent Changes[/h1]\r\n\r\nCurrently Pet Re-rolls consume Green Crystals, the same as accessories. With the [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update, we are switching this to Red Crystals instead. This is so we give specific purpose to each of the crystals. After this update, Red Crystals will be for your pet talent changes, Green Crystals will be for accessories, and Blue Crystals will be for your armor.\r\n\r\nSame as the Lv. 60 Trader's Ribbons, we thought this would be important to know ahead of time, so that players who plan to re-roll their pets' talents will have time to accrue the right crystals for their needs.\r\n\r\n[h1]Maple Life Improvements[/h1]\r\n\r\nWith the [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update, we're introducing some additional changes we wanted to bring related to housing. This includes:\r\nMeso House Assistants\r\nHouse Assistants available for hire have previously been a meret-only service, but we're now introducing Meso House Assistants. We'll be adding four Meso House Assistants, just like Meret House Assistants, with all four specialties: Ring, Necklace, Beverage and Cooking. For those who have Meret House Assistants, rest assured: Meret House Assistants function better than Meso House Assistants, as they require fewer materials to craft the items.\r\nPlot Purchase Price Reduction by 90%\r\nWe're also going to permanently reduce the house plot purchase and extension costs by 90%. While we've done similar changes as limited-time events, the feedback and activity that resulted has convinced us to make this a permanent change. We'd love to see you decorate the world of MapleStory 2 with your own colors!\r\nNew Housing Blocks from Community Requests\r\nWe asked, we heard, and we listened. We're adding 18 community-suggested objects and blocks from overworld to housing blocks, including picture frames, glass windows and the almighty Foosball table! There are also some popular community items in the Style Crate and Paulie's Hairstyles this time around!\r\nAnd More!\r\nWe haven't forgotten players concern over the lack of Onyx Crystals. To remedy this, we've crafted [b]Skilled Ally[/b] update events to favor Onyx Crystal rewards. We are also preparing weekend discount events on enchant materials to aid you for the month.\r\n\r\n[h1]In Closing[/h1]\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, in today's blog we mentioned things at a mostly high level. We will discuss the changes in more detail in this week's livestream, but the main reason we opted to wait to share the full details in the Patch Notes is because we are still making some final adjustments, especially on the skill rebalancing pass.\r\n\r\nI hope I don't sound like a broken record by saying that our ears are open and always ready to hear more from you about MapleStory 2. We care deeply about your feedback because we truly believe that's the only way we can build a better game together.\r\n\r\nWe've discussed a lot today but I know you'd like more details on some topics. Please be on the lookout for the official [b]Skilled Ally[/b] Events, Sales and Patch Notes posts next week for more information. We also have an [url=https://www.twitch.tv/playmaple2]official preview livestream[/url] happening on [b]July 18th at 1:00 PM PDT (8:00 PM UTC)[/b] to discuss next week's update, so don't miss your chance to join the conversation.

This package contains 5 Style Crates, and can be purchased once for 300 Blue Merets.\r\n\r\nThe last four weeks of MapleStory 2: Awakening have been filled with excitement, and for the month of July we're following up with new additions to make your adventures with your friends in Maple World all the better! Join up with your guildmates for two new challenging Guild Raids and hit the dance floor to face off against other guilds with Guild Dance Dance Stop every week!\r\n\r\n[h1]Guild Dance Dance Stop[/h1]\r\n\r\nDance Dance Stop is one of MapleStory 2's best mini-games, and you can now take on other guilds to determine who's the best at Dance Dance Stop!\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/2d4fc0c257b571da51b5cffe166b2b9507fbb948.png[/img]\r\n[i]Note: Test image, tile numbers not representative of final version[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Guild Dance Dance Stop[/b] functions a bit differently from the normal variety you know and love. The goal is for your guild to have more players left on the floor at the end of each round than your opponent, and the best of five rounds wins the match. The tricky part is that you're sharing the floor with the other team, sharing the squares with them... and it would be such a shame if you hopped off the square with six opponents on it at the last second, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nGuild Dance Dance Stop will be available at [b]every Saturday at 7:00 PM local server time[/b], and your guild will be able to participate in as many matches as they can for the following two hours. Your guild will earn [b]Guild Coins[/b], [b]Guild Funds[/b] and [b]Guild Experience[/b] for playing, with a much greater share going to the winning team. Get your guild together, plan your strategy and dance the night away every week!\r\n\r\n[b]Guild Dance Dance Stop Details:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Guild Dance Dance Stop will be added to the game. Guilds compete in a competitive dance-off on the disco floor, with the winner bringing in a big influx of guild cash.[/*]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]This event occurs every [b]Saturday at 7:00 PM local server time for 2 hours[/b]:[/*]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]NA West (PDT, UTC -7): 7:00 PM PDT / 2:00 AM Sunday UTC[/*]\r\n[*]NA East (EDT, UTC -4): 7:00 PM EDT / 11:00 PM UTC[/*]\r\n[*]South America (BRT, UTC -3): 7:00 PM BRT / 10:00 PM UTC[/*]\r\n[*]Europe (CEST, UTC +2): 7:00 PM CEST / 5:00 PM UTC[/*]\r\n[*]Oceania (AEST, UTC +10): 7:00 PM AEDT / 9:00 AM UTC[/*]\r\n[*]UTC times are currently planned to remain the same for all servers, even after Daylight Saving Time begins and ends.[/*]\r\n[/list][*]Guilds may queue up at the designated time to play as many games as they can for the duration of the event.[/*]\r\n[*]Players can enter the match up to 90 seconds after the first player has entered in a successful queue.[/*]\r\n[*]Guilds must have a minimum of 10 players participating in each round, up to a maximum of 30 players. If a guild has less than 10 players participating during a round, it is disqualified.[/*]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]In the event one team is disqualified due to a lack of members and the other team has more than 10 members, then the team with more than 10 members will automatically win and receive the “loser’s reward”. The disqualified team gets nothing.[/*]\r\n[*]Automatic matchmaking will try to match guilds with similar amounts of online players to each other.[/*]\r\n[*]There is no system that evens out the playing field. Bring as many of your comrades as the stage can fit![/*]\r\n[*]If your guild has more than 30 players in the instance, the game will randomly select 30 to place in the stage.[/*]\r\n[/list][*]In a best of 5 rounds, the objective is to have more surviving members on the dance floor than the other team.[/*]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]When the timer hits 0, whichever guild has more players on the dance floor wins the point.[/*]\r\n[*]In the event of a draw, neither team gets the point.[/*]\r\n[*]Unlike the normal Dance Dance Stop there are a few changes to make it more streamlined for a GvG setting:[/*]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]The amount of time each round takes is the same, and does not gradually decrease.[/*]\r\n[*]Tiles with especially high numbers have been removed.[/*]\r\n[*]Putting up the barrier takes 0.5 seconds (normally 0.2 seconds).[/*]\r\n[*]Putting down the barrier takes 1 second (normally 3 seconds).[/*]\r\n[*]You can activate a barrier if you and your guildmates matched tile's number when a tile was 2 or higher. However, if an enemy guild's player is on the tile, you can't activate a barrier.[/*]\r\n[/list][/list][*]Upon winning or losing a match, your guild will be awarded an appropriate amount of guild funds as well as guild coins for every member depending on the level of your guild.[/*]\r\n[/list][/list]\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/455503bca39b752ddb4c969b4fa7ee8704b862ba.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]New Guild Raids[/h1]\r\n\r\nWith the first phase of the Skybound Expansion back in December, we unveiled a new set of challenges for guilds to undertake: Guild Raids! These special dungeons focus on difficult, coordination-centric contest, and with the Guilded Glory Update we've added a pair of new Guild Raids for you to take on!\r\n\r\n[h1]L4: Ice Beast's Den[/h1]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/5c2ab62964bffc9c00e87ad66ec8e6ae0feec6a7.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Ice Beast's Den[/b] is the new L4 Guild Raid, where you and your fellow guildmates must push through sections of precision jumping and careful climbing before taking on groups of monsters. But while the fearsome Ice Beast is a foe to truly dread, it's the whipping cold around you that seeks to hurt you the most.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/a733bda5206ba97e7035ceff759515b0f5229ac0.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAt least the Override Control: Climate Control will protect you for a time, because dodging attacks or holding onto the wall is hard to do when you're frozen solid! This device will cost you 30 Guild Coins from Marianne in your Guild House, and can be purchased up to 30 times per week... but it will only last you for two minutes, so either stock up well or watch out below!\r\n\r\n[h1]L5: The Eternal Arena[/h1]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33702547/8dd23658647c70912c3abe1cfa4c534c19935509.png[/img]\r\n\r\nOnce you're finished with the Ice Beast's Den, you'll be able to enter the L5 Guild Raid, the [b]Eternal Arena[/b]!

You have only five minutes to win, so don't waste a moment!\r\n\r\n[b]Guild Raid L4/L5 Details:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]In L4: Ice Beast’s Den, you’ll have to equip yourself with an Override Code: Climate Control from Marianne in your Guild House for 30 Guild Coins (weekly stock of 30) in order to brave the frigid chills.
