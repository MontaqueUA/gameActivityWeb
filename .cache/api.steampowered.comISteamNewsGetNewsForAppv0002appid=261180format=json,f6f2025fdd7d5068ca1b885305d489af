After many iterations, the parry has finally reached a form that is fair to high and low level players on low and high speed. An array of smaller tweaks are also included.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Dice[/b]\r\nAfter the first year of post-release, I've been more or less hands off in terms of character balance. I believe it's a good thing that these things don't constantly change. After consideration I have decided to make an exemption for Dice. He received some tweaks that make his special move faster and a little more versatile. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Parry[/b]\r\nParrying at low speed now allows the victim to live, but grants full energy to the initiator. This allows specials to be used to guarantee ball control after release. At high speed, parries become a certain kill instead.\r\n\r\nJust activating the parry increases the speed by 3 now. Which makes it harder to constantly spam (as you'll lose the ball over time due to the speed). And can be used as a tool to speed up the ball more without doing a more predictable smash.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Change log:[/b]\r\n- Parry hitpause delay scales from 40 to 80 speed, 29 frames to 0\r\n- Additional hitpause delay is added if the player is parried from behind\r\n- Serve Auto-parry knockback is reduced to make it certain-kill\r\n- A successful parry completely fills up the energy meter now\r\n- Special moves can be performed after a successful parry, but will be activated at the end of the hitpause\r\n- Parry knockback stun releases 3 frames earlier when pushed against a wall\r\n- Dice's special ball bounce duration is reduced from 16 to 8 frames\r\n- Dice can now choose to release a bunted ball from the ground by holding 'down'\r\n- Reduced clash knockback\r\n- Endlessly extending parry hitpause bug fixed\r\n- Player release before ball release on parry bug fixed\r\n- Latch sprite fix on taunt\r\n- Switch sprite fix on various frames \r\n\r\n[url=twitter.com/ReptileGames] Follow Team Reptile on twitter [/url]\r\n[url=twitter.com/TR_Dion] Follow Dion on twitter [/url]\r\n[url=twitter.com/RemmersTim] Follow Tim on twitter [/url]","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1467725175,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":261180},{"gid":"295355928884318332","title":"Jaw Breakers Live Video","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/295355928884318332","is_external_url":true,"author":"[TR]Tim","contents":"https://youtu.be/guqDJnGkmnM\r\nHype matches, top players from all around Europe and a great setting made the first live Lethal League tournament an event to remember!

As evidenced by a beachball in a winter update. Try the new ball type out under ‘ball type’ in the character select options dropdown. Aside from gameplay tweaks, we focussed our attention to connectivity issues players have had when playing online and rematching. Despite being inherently hard to pinpoint, we were able to solve various problems.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jr-gs8CqCw\r\n\r\nNext, let’s go through some of the changes.\r\n\r\n[b]Spectator mode[/b]\r\nYou can now join a game lobby and be a spectator. If the lobby is already full with 4 players you will be automatically assigned to a spectator spot. As a spectator you can watch the match and won’t experience any lag which is ideal for streaming matches and tournaments.\r\n\r\n[b]Flashing effects[/b]\r\nIf you've ever been bothered by the white or black flashes during gameplay or are sensitive to such effects, there is now an option to turn them off in the Game options.\r\n\r\n[b]Scaling parry knockback[/b]\r\nThis is a big chance for higher level play. The knockback duration after being parried is now linked to the speed (and therefore hitpause) of the ball. This should mean no more guaranteed parry K.O’s on lower speeds, making matches reach higher speeds on average. On lower speeds, parry victims will have time to take a swing and the parry initiator can choose to aim towards or away from his or her target.\r\n\r\n[b]Clashing limited to facing[/b]\r\nYou can now only clash with attacks oriented towards you. Clashing was a bit too random and not fun enough to make up for it. This should stop the more odd-looking cases of clashing.\r\n\r\n[b]#FreeCorpseJuggling[/b]\r\nThe hard limit of 5 corpse hits has been removed. However, once the ball is in play in the next burst, active corpses can not be hit anymore and energy is reset. Also, corpse hurtboxes have been scaled down a bit to make more sense visually.\r\n\r\n[b]Holiday modifications[/b]\r\nThe holiday modifications are back! We also added a christmas tree to Room 21 and gave Candyman a nice christmas hat. For all your safety we removed the slippery ice physics in the Abandoned Pool. If you’re reading this you’ll most likely own a copy of the game but if you have some friends or family who, for some reason, don’t own the game there is always the holiday sale. 66% OFF! You can get a 4-pack for the prize of one copy. Ridiculous.\r\n\r\n[b]Changelog[/b]\r\n– Added spectator mode\r\n– Added beachball ball type, unlocked by default\r\n– Corpse hurtbox size is reduced by 25%.\r\n– Dynamic parry knockback, except for serves\r\n– Corpses can now be hit until the ball is fully returned in play\r\n– All player energy is reset at the reactivation of the ball now\r\n– Swing clashes and bunt clashes now only happen when facing each other\r\n– Fixed screen shake interrupting/overlapping which caused long shakes to suddenly stop\r\n- Added an option to disable flashing effects\r\n– Moved extra impact effect to speeds over 50\r\n– Taunt resets the ball in training mode\r\n– Added a bunt and a taunt to a certain character\r\n– Fixed corpses freezing on special activation of a certain character\r\n– Added an effect on a certain character’s special\r\n– Dice can now also superjump by holding up\r\n– Dice UI graphics tweaked\r\n– Raptor special hold doesn’t default to his smash angle anymore\r\n– Fixed CPU looking to the right after a burst\r\n– Fixed CPU not respecting parries\r\n– Fixed the boombox hitpause meter ignoring the parry hit\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nBest wishes from the whole team.
