I haven't really played Hyper Light Drifter since it came out, so the game that exists in my mind is probably subtly different to the game that sits somewhere on my hard-drive. No matter. In my memory, Hyper Light Drifter is the perfect piece of video game storytelling, and I think the reason for this is sort of perverse and interesting.</p><p>Let me be more specific. Hyper Light Drifter strikes me as being the perfect piece of video game <em>environmental</em> storytelling. And to play straw men for a second, I have an idea in my head of how environmental storytelling should probably work in most games. The world of the game should be filled with doodads. Things to click on to get an animation or a reaction, sure, but also text files, audio logs, emails carefully salted with spelling mistakes, desk furniture with pictures of absent people's cats, material culture to pick through and collect and examine later on in some menu or other.</p><p>In my mind, Hyper Light Drifter has none of that. Or almost none of it. I can't be sure, but I don't really remember reading very much as I played through this game, working further and further into a world where nature was increasingly corrupted by some grim form of technology. I don't remember triggering any audio logs and learning (one of four) about someone's first day working in a sinister government instalment. I don't remember uncovering a chain of memos, or an ancient series of tablets listing episodic prophecies. (I do remember the very odd conversation, which played out in static images, and taken as a whole were one of the game's rare weak elements.)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-16-in-my-memory-hyper-light-drifter-is-a-perfect-piece-of-video-game-storytelling\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1565949600,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":257850},{"gid":"2412160539854818708","title":"Your next free games on the Epic Store are Hyper Light Drifter and Mutant Year Zero","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/2412160539854818708","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-08-08-19-32/your-next-free-games-on-the-epic-store-are-hyper-light-drifter-and-mutant-year-zero-1565289156403.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2052310.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Should your increasingly insurmountable library of video game freebies still not quite be tottering enough for your liking, Epic has revealed that Hyper Light Drifter and Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden will be available for nowt on its store next week.</p><p>For those that need an introduction, Hyper Light Drifter is the work of developer Heart Machine, and originally launched on PC back in 2016.
