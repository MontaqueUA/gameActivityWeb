Structures may be impossible in the here and now, but have the potential to exist given enough time or technological development: a futuristic cityscape, a spacefaring megastructure, the ruins of an  alien civilisation. However, there are also buildings that defy the physical laws of space. It is not an issue that they <em>could</em> not exist, but that they <em>should</em> not. Their forms bend and warp in unthinkable ways; dream-like structures that push spatial logic to its breaking point.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUgWwkOEweE&amp;t=3469s\" target=\"_blank\">Tomb of Porsena</a> is a legendary monument built to house the body of an Etruscan king. 400 years after its construction, the Roman scholar Varro gave a detailed description of the ancient structure. A giant stone base rose 50 feet high, beneath it lay an \"inextricable labyrinth\", and atop it sat five pyramids. Above this was a brass sphere, four more pyramids, a platform and then a final five pyramids. The image painted by Varro, one of shapes stacked upon shapes, seems like a wild exaggeration. Despite this, Varro's fanciful description sparked the imaginations of countless architects over the centuries. The tomb was an enigma, and yet the difficulty in conceptualising it, and the vision behind it, was fascinating. On paper artists were free to realise its potential. If paper liberated minds, the screen can surely open up further possibilities. There's no shortage of visionary structures within the virtual spaces of video games. These are strange buildings that ask us to imagine worlds radically different to our own. </p><p>Whilst many impossible formulations are orientated towards the future, there are also plenty from the past. The castle in Ico is one example of this. During the Renaissance, Europe was obsessed, not with future utopias, but with ancient Greece and Rome. While the box art of Ico is famously inspired by <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/1106?=undefined&amp;page=1&amp;direction=\" target=\"_blank\">Giorgio de Chirico</a>, the long shadows and sun-bleached stone walls only make-up a portion of the game's mood. It is the etchings of <a href=\"http://www.graphicine.com/giovanni-battista-piranesi-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Giovanni Piranesi</a> that best capture what it's like to explore the castle's winding stairs and bridges. Piranesi's imaginary Roman reconstructions were absurdly big - so colossal you could get lost in just the foundations. In a similar way, Ico's castle is impossibly large, the camera zooming out in order to overwhelm you and build up the unfathomable mystery of its origin and purpose.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-12-the-impossible-architecture-of-video-games\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1549958400,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":220},{"gid":"2417770561721237679","title":"Charity speedrunning marathon Awesome Games Done Quick 2019 starts today","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2417770561721237679","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Jay Castello)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/01/gdq.png/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" />\nI hope you didn   t have anything planned this week, because speedrunning extravaganza <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/games-done-quick/\">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> starts today at 4:30pm GMT.</p>\n<p>If you   ve never tuned in before, AGDQ is a weeklong, 24/7 marathon of games, all played as fast as possible, while streaming on Twitch and raising a whole shedload of cash for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

Dark Souls YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCGO21T72E2hcJyBNzM1gA\" target=\"_blank\">Lance McDonald</a> has built his reputation on uncovering all sorts of fascinating bosses, enemies, and systems that were removed from Dark Souls games prior to release. And in his latest video, Lance shows off a bizarre system he found hidden in an alpha version of Dark Souls 3 that allows him to sacrifice enemies and create bonfires just about anywhere he wants.</p><p>You should first watch the video above to see it all in action, but what Lance discovered is a massive insight into how Dark Souls 3 might&apos;ve worked at one point in time. The idea is that sometimes slain enemies would emit an ominous glow the moment they died, indicating that these enemies suffered what&apos;s oddly called a &quot;cult death.&quot; In the video, Lance can use the alpha version&apos;s debug menu to assign this parameter freely to enemies for the purposes of demonstrating what it can do. When enemies die a cult death, the player can then pick up their body and drag it anywhere in the world.</p><p>This system ties into another scrapped concept wherein players could &quot;join a cult&quot;&#x2014;though Lance admits he doesn&apos;t know what that means or how to do it. Using a debug menu Lance can join one automatically, and there&apos;s seven to choose from that closely mirror the options players have when resting at a bonfire. When in a cult, like the one that allows you to level up, players can perform a &quot;ceremony&quot; on cult death bodies, which triggers an animation that essentially transforms the corpse into a bonfire.</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p>The unfinished animation of the \"ceremony.\"</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea, I think, was that players could join a cult that would allow them to turn slain enemies into bonfires with limited usage. You might join a cult so that you can create your own bonfires to level up, or one that&apos;ll let you summon an NPC for aid.</p><p>But wait, there&apos;s more.</p><p>In the second half of the video, Lance demonstrates how these cult death enemies were also a key ingredient in a new way of invading other players. In the inventory menu, Lance discovered two &quot;ceremony swords&quot; that served an interesting purpose. One sword would let you invade another player&apos;s world, while the second sword eclipsed your world in darkness and opened you up to invasion from other players. PVP is obviously a big part of Darks Souls 3, and this system looks like one way players could&apos;ve guaranteed themselves some PVP action.</p><p>Sadly, the system never made it into the game. But <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/29/18118391/dark-souls-3-sacrifice-ceremony-sword-cult-death-system\" target=\"_blank\">as Polygon rightly points out</a>, it was obviously intended to be a proper feature considering a Dark Souls 3 statue first displayed at E3 2015 depicted the ceremony necessary to trigger the invasion. Oh well. You can see a video of the statue below.</p><p><em>Thanks, </em><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/29/18118391/dark-souls-3-sacrifice-ceremony-sword-cult-death-system\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Polygon.</em></a></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQLxV19N-NU\"></iframe>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1543531404,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":374320},{"gid":"2415514774183730581","title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2018: Best PC gaming deals","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2415514774183730581","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (The Dealer)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2017/08/revolt-petticoats-1600-black-friday.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2017/08/revolt-petticoats-1600-black-friday.jpg/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>Is&#8230; is it over yet?

Please don&apos;t be shy about switching the difficulty if you get stuck.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;You may also notice a vanilla mechanic that usually doesn&apos;t come into play very much: most enemies will calmly stay out of the way if you&apos;re already being attacked by a few others. If you find that a little underwhelming, the &apos;Impolite Enemies&apos; optional file will remove their qualms about ganging up on you.&quot;</p><p>TKGP says that to the best of their knowledge Enemy Onslaught can be used online without issue, but that they recommend switching to offline mode &quot;just to be safe&quot;&#x2014;particularly if you don&apos;t play with friends.

At the end of that video, McDonald promised some &quot;absolutely WEIRD&quot; stuff in the coming weeks. This now takes the form of the ARPG&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8IvzBq9OVM\" target=\"_blank\">axed Ceremony database</a>&#x2014;&quot;a set of parameters DS3 uses to dynamically change the world state or time of day.&quot;</p><p>As outlined above, things start off fairly tame. Manually changing the time of day switches to a different &apos;Ceremony&apos;, which in practice sees the Cemetery of Ash flip to the Untended Graves&#x2014;areas identical in likeness, with different enemy layouts and lighting. Likewise, Archdragon Peak is seen pre and post-storm; and the High Wall of Lothric is seen with the Dark Sign Eclipse triggered and untriggered.&#xA0;</p><p>As things progress, things get progressively weird. The &apos;Evening/Dusk&apos; Ceremony offers a gorgeous, purple/pink sky texture that looks like this: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&apos;Moonlit Night&apos;, as the name might suggest, plunges the world into darkness:&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whereas &apos;The Past&apos; drains Lothric of colour further still. This monochrome setting might be my favourite.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&apos;The Sun&apos; cranks the light back up to 11.&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While &apos;Eclipsed Night&apos; portrays light and dark in concert.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And then things get super weird. Here&apos;s an excerpt from McDonald&apos;s narration: &quot;Now, I did say we&apos;re saving the best till last and to do that we&apos;re heading to The Undead Settlement, which is the only map in the game where The Eclipse Ceremony is accompanied by a sky filled with creatures.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>Skip to the 8-minute mark in the video above to see that in full. Otherwise, here&apos;s some screens.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>McDonald continues: &quot;And perhaps even more striking is that this same thing happens during the Sun Ceremony.&quot;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After pointing out that these flying beasts cast dynamic shadows, McDonald says: &quot;It&apos;s hard to imagine how exactly the game was once planned to progress through these different world states&#x2014;would the time of day just organically changed as you played through the game?&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;And the more abstract ones, such as The Past, The Sun and The Eclipse Ceremonies certainly appear to be fairly climactic, which gives us a lot to think about with regards to how the game may have once been planned to end.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8IvzBq9OVM\" target=\"_blank\">McDonald concludes by turning lore speculation and suggestions over to his viewers</a>.

The decayed, moss-stained ramparts are populated exclusively by mindless undead, ornery dragons, forsaken soldiers, and obsidian-skinned demons. The capital of Anor Londo is home to a worthless, greedy class of gods who intend to hold onto their waning power until the flame goes out. Dark Souls is about subsisting under that threat forever; to thrive while being crushed by the impossible magnitude of mystery and razor-tight attack animations. So, naturally, I was surprised to find a three hour video of a man <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnYi34bpIY8&amp;t=1275s\" target=\"_blank\">whispering strategies for each of the boss encounters</a> in Dark Souls 3.</p><p>Sure enough, I had found the nexus of the Dark Souls ASMR scene. If you&apos;re somehow unfamiliar with the term, ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response, which is a diagnosis of the tingling sense of satisfaction you might get when someone crinkles a plastic bag, or raps their fingernails against a piece of aluminum. YouTubers around the world have developed robust careers out of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8QmqObitjY\">stoking those uncanny tingles</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjDcCuQjX30\" target=\"_blank\">in the minds of their viewers</a>, and the videos can be pretty creative. (Here for instance, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wNEUfiOR34\">an ASMR cyberpunk roleplay</a>.) So I suppose it&apos;s not shocking that the culture found a home in Dark Souls, but it certainly makes you consider the degree of difficulty. I mean, black metal ASMR doesn&apos;t exist for a reason, right? (OK, PC Gamer associate editor James Davenport tells me <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgi3F9sQ4_I\">it actually <em>does </em>exist</a>. But my point still stands!)</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnYi34bpIY8\"></iframe>\n<p>That boss guide was recorded by a man who publishes work on a channel called The ASMR Review Show, and he&apos;s done similarly hushed walkthroughs for both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6Yj3FS6Uc\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Souls 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoQnklOLHQo\" target=\"_blank\">Bloodborne</a> (alongside his more traditional tranquilizing reviews for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vV5bl7fwn4\" target=\"_blank\">Marvel movies</a>.) The man behind the curtain didn&apos;t respond to my request for comment, but that wasn&apos;t a problem because I quickly discovered that he was far from the only person working this gimmick. ASMR figurehead Ephemeral Rift did an extremely zen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YautbMuwlMI\" target=\"_blank\">Let&apos;s Play for the first game in the series back in 2013</a>, a YouTuber named Morpheus <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=butS2dypW0w\" target=\"_blank\">spent 20 minutes reading Dark Souls 2 item descriptions</a> last year, and a Twitch streamer who goes by Nyanners recently completed a two hour broadcast where she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVBhKRDklGc\" target=\"_blank\">listlessly recited the franchise&apos;s verbose Wiki for a captive audience.&#xA0;</a></p><p>However, by far the most famous, and most successful Dark Souls ASMR artist is AlternateAurora. Unlike the other people in her business, Aurora goes the extra mile by roleplaying characters from the series, thus recontextualizing them into doting, peaceful caretakers who have absolutely no interest in forcing you to do a lengthy corpse run. In one of her dispatches, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWY8JHSRYc&amp;t=24s\" target=\"_blank\">she speaks on behalf of Crossbreed Priscilla</a>, who you may remember as that outrageously annoying boss in the Painted World who has a bad habit of turning invisible in high-pressure moments. Of course, Aurora interprets Priscilla as a warm matriarch urging you back to sleep&#x2014;someone with absolutely no interest in tearing you in two with her scythe.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/olWY8JHSRYc\"></iframe>\n<figure><blockquote><p>You indulge a glint of happiness and hopefulness that's gone extinct in this dying realm.</p><figcaption><cite></cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>\n<p>Aurora writes all of her scripts herself by scrutinizing every scrap of dialogue and fan theory she can find of the character she&apos;s roleplaying. (She&apos;ll also occasionally pantomime her own homebrewed denizens within the Souls universe, which she says are the hardest to get right because, &quot;When you don&apos;t have a template, it can be easy to stray too far.&quot;) In the past, Aurora taken the guise of the doll liaison in Bloodborne&apos;s Hunter&apos;s Dream, and the croaking undead merchant lying dormant and behind bars in the annals of the Undead Burg (the latter being one of the more radical risks she&apos;s taken as an ASMR creator).&#xA0;</p><p>I ask her where she&apos;s found so much inspiration for pacifying ambiance in this series&#x2014;the calm moments that helped her shape the sedate, new-age meditation material amidst the 10-foot skeletons and wriggling mountains of flesh. Her answer made more sense to me than I expected. There&apos;s a euphoric reprise, she says, after you&apos;ve fallen one of those titanic boss encounters, and your character finally discovers refuge at a hidden bonfire. You indulge a glint of happiness and hopefulness that&apos;s gone extinct in this dying realm, and you live to fight another day.</p><p>&quot;The contrast between how difficult and oppressive some areas are compared to the more serene and quiet places you can find yourself in is amazing,&quot; says Aurora. &quot;I&apos;ll never forget stumbling into Ash Lake for the first time, or how safe I felt at Firelink when I first found myself stumbling through the Burg. For me, the game really nailed its atmosphere and that&apos;s part of what makes it such a strong experience. You have all this suffering set up against the backdrop of a beautiful world and it just makes it that much more poignant.&quot;</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMyhjk85xjE\"></iframe>\n<p>I&apos;m currently about three quarters of the way through my first playthrough of Dark Souls. Most recently, my lonely knight fell to his death through a trapdoor full of carnivorous beasties in the hateful caverns of Lost Izalith. Everything I was taught about this game remains true; it&apos;s frustrating, the difficulty spikes are palpable and stringent, and you shouldn&apos;t expect to pick up on everything your first time through. That being said, I also kinda get where Aurora and other ASMR artists like her are coming from.&#xA0;</p><p>Breaking bread with Solaire, or taking a pregnant moment to admire the sun-bathed vista from Anor Londo&#x2014;those are the moments that stand out in my head so far, and they&apos;re also the moments I yearn for the most. It is often said that Dark Souls was the game that forced this industry to reckon with what was lost as singleplayer campaigns became easier and obsequious. I suppose the same can be for ASMR, too.
