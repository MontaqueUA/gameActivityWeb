It saves memory by loading certain data as needed, and unloading it when it’s not used for a while.

[/b]\r\n\r\nWe’ve been working on improving performance and have a few changes that should make things better. This should particularly help with severe lag in interiors. But some of the backend changes are larger than we are comfortable to just deploy. We have set up a beta branch that people can go to and help us test out the changes. \r\n\r\nAn added benefit of some of the changes, is that the interior system has opened up to the other worlds, not just Hamlet worlds. So if you bring the Key to the City, you can build a pig city in the forest or even on a tropical island. I’m sure there’s some interactions with all this stuff we haven’t predicted yet, so having some more people playing with it will be helpful. \r\n\r\nWe’ve also put player craftable doors in the home decor tab. Once you’ve build a door in your house, you can use a Construction Permit on it to create an attached room.\r\n\r\n[b]To access the beta branch:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Go to the BETAS tab in the Don’t Starve Properties dialogue. \r\n[*] Enter the code: [b]dsinteriorbeta[/b] and press the CHECK CODE button.\r\n[*] Select [b]hamet_interors - Hamlet Interior upgrade beta[/b] from the drop down.\r\n[*] Your game will then update to the new beta branch. \r\n[/list]\r\nThis branch uses separate save files from your regular base game.

Expect to see more content in every season, as well as a new boss creature.

We know that some of you have been experiencing performance issues in particular, and we’re working hard to solve as many of those as we can. \r\n\r\nAnd with that, we will have completed our third expansion to Don’t Starve.

This update focuses on making our new Hamlet characters more interesting for you to play, particularly when playing outside of the Hamlet world.\r\n\r\nWilba has inherited one of her father's more colourful characteristics, namely, she now carries the same curse that inflicts all of her father's family with dreaded werepigism. Also, all of pigkind from Hamlet's town pigs to those of ROG will now recognize her as the king's daughter, and pay her tribute in the form of gifts.\r\n\r\nWe weren't very happy with how Warbucks was working out. While trying to find ways to make him work, we decided that he just wasn't as interesting as we would like, and so we've made the decision to start from scratch with a new character. You can still continue your Warbucks saves as his files will not be removed from the game, but he will no longer be in the official lineup of starting characters. \r\n\r\nInstead, we would like to introduce to you our new character, Wormwood! Who knows where this creature of nature came from, but he'll likely grow on you.\r\n\r\nThank you for playing, and we look forward to hearing your feedback!\r\n \r\n\r\n[h1]New features[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Added options for disabling the decorative vines and the canopy shadow in Hamlet for lower-end hardware.\r\n[*]Blooming Rainforest trees will drop burrs when chopped[/list]\r\n[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Webber's disguise will show up if put on the ground now.\r\n[*]Fixed random startup crash with blueprints in Hamlet compatible worlds.\r\n[*]Fixed assert when trying to launch the game with The Screecher mod enabled.\r\n[*]Lazy Forager doesn’t collect items off shelves anymore.

We start the new year with an update that brings several nice and fun features from Don't Starve Together to regular Don't Starve. These additions were added to the base game and all DLCs. \r\n[list][*]Beefalo taming and riding (Saddles, Brush, Saddlehorn)\r\n[*]The Ewecus (for Steel Wool)\r\n[*]Fences (Gates and Walls)\r\n[*]Bundles (and Wax Paper and Bee's Wax)\r\n[*]Mini signs (and the Feather Pen for writing)\r\n[*]Action Key ability while holding an item on your cursor\r\n[*]Trap pickup using the action key[/list]\r\nAlong with these additions, the artists took some time to do a visual color pass of Hamlet. Some changes are larger than others, like seasonal tints and the new background color, and others are smaller, like the claw palm leaf color.  \r\n\r\nAs well, controller support was improved when interacting with interiors and interior decorating. \r\n\r\n[h1]What's Next?[/h1]\r\n\r\nWe would like to revisit Warbucks and Wilba. We think both characters could be improved so that they are more interesting to play outside of Hamlet. Watch for the new and improved Wilba and Warbucks as they try to stick to their new years resolutions to become better rounded on Feb 7th.\r\n\r\n[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 303256 (1/14/2019)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Character stays suck by goo properly when hit while gooed (Bring friends or armor.)\r\n[*]Fixed graphics glitch when examining \r\n[*]Fixed sneeze graphics glitch\r\n[*]Fixed Wilbur run when riding beefalo\r\n[*]Fixed the weird Cave Banana Tree in Hamlet compatible worlds.\r\n[*]Fix for assert when burning a minisign in Vanilla worlds\r\n[*]Fix assert when placing a gate in Vanilla or ROG worlds\r\n[*]Fixed assert when a babybeefalo grew up in Hamlet or Hamlet compatible world\r\n[*]Dismount with controller fixed\r\n[*]Fences should load properly\r\n[*]Fixup for items that went missing from locked display cases. \r\n[*]Beefalo mounts attack and take damage properly[/list] \r\n\r\n[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 303169 (1/11/2019)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fix for potential crash when closing craft-tabs in Hamlet\r\n[*]Fixed the Flingomatic \r\n[*]Fixed the brush crash \r\n[*]Fixed Beefalo shaving\r\n[*]Fix for missing items on shelves\r\n[*]Fixed several animation bugs when riding\r\n[*]Open close gate use anim fixed\r\n[*]Fixed the ApplyBuildOverrides crash on baby beefalo\r\n[*]Fixed disappearing items in shift-click[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 302970 (1/11/2019)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fixed the craft tab scrolling crash\r\n[*]Fixed the Hamlet compatible ROG crash[/list]\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1547169464,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":219740},{"gid":"2417771014042882909","title":"[Game Update] Hamlet - 302650  302498 ","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2417771014042882909","is_external_url":true,"author":"Klei_Jan","contents":"[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 302650 (1/9/2019)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[B]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fix for yesterday’s patch which caused a crash when trying to modify world settings with no DLC installed[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 302498 (1/8/2019)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[B]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Miner hat doesn't magically emit light anymore after re-entering an interior where it was left on the ground\r\n[*]Fixed the rare relic that spawns outside the bounds of the room\r\n[*]Fix for custom options and ROG worlds that are SW or Hamlet compatible[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 301875 (1/3/2019)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[B]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Different handling for aporkalypse clock save load\r\n[*]Willow’s lighter should not lost light when moving between interior rooms\r\n[*]Lanterns now properly remember whether they were on or off in interiors[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]PREVIOUS UPDATES[/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1][Game Update] Hamlet - 301799 (12/21/2018)[/h1]\r\n\r\n[B]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Hopefully fixed elusive ‘attempt to call nil value’ bug.\r\n[*]Shadow creatures spawned by aporkalypse now also despawn when aporkalypse ends\r\n[*]Creatures spawned by aporkalypse now remember this fact after a save/load, so they should despawn when aporkalypse ends.
