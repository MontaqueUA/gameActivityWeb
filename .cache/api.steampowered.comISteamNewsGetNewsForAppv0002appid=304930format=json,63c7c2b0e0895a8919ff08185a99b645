For more details: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/304930/discussions/0/1639793203769904954/]Read Here[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Maps:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]When searching for a particular map, the server list will only show servers running the same version as you have installed. The map filter has also been replaced with a text map name filter which allows searching for maps not installed locally. If a local map is detected (by prefix) the search will use that full name.\r\n[*]Improvements to how curated maps are featured in-game. Rio's release was not as clearly communicated, so the map has been re-featured.\r\n[*]Workshop maps feedback button links to discussion board.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Hosting:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Dedicated server monitors for updates while hosting a workshop map. By default the server will notify players that it is shutting down for an update, but this can be configured in WorkshopDownloadConfig.json or overridden by plugins. \r\n[*]Auto workshop downloads now try to use cached installs aggressively. Steam does cache auto-installed items for a period, but still prefers to re-download them. Now the game looks for the \"Needs Update\" flag, and if not detected, will skip re-downloading. The goal here is to improve join times for servers with large numbers of auto-download content, but if problematic, subscribing will keep the content up-to-date.\r\n[*]Threaded console is now the default, but the older console can be enabled with -LegacyConsole command-line flag. This may conflict with Rocketmod's console on Linux until updated, however the hope is to improve vanilla dedicated server support.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Plugins:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Hashed player hardware ID is available server-side for use banning. Cheaters will obviously use fake HWIDs, but it's another tool in the administrative tool belt.\r\n[*]Server relay can immediately redirect. If there is a negative player response to this feature it will be adjusted or disabled.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Modding:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Made Mannequins moddable and exported an example package.\r\n[*]Guns with fire delay can include \"FireDelay\" sound played at input.\r\n[*]Slot type \"Any\" for useables that can be equipped in primary, secondary, or inventory.\r\n[*]Can_Aim_During_Sprint option for guns.\r\n[*]Allow_Magazine_Change gun option similar to Hook_X options.\r\n[*]Should_Fill_After_Detach option for magazines. This effectively provides infinite ammo, with the trade-off of choosing the time to reload.\r\n[*]Visible_On_Ragdoll option for large clothes.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Fixes:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Vehicles now respawn up to max instances when multiple are destroyed simultaneously.\r\n[*]Disconnect if server workshop usage does not match advertised usage.\r\n[*]Fixed potential exploit destroying holiday / timed objects.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Curated Map | Rio de Janeiro:[/h1]\r\n\r\nTravel to South America with Rio, now available in-game! It features iconic destinations such as the redeemer statue, and has future updates planned. For more details check out the map's workshop page: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1821848824]Read Here[/url]\r\n\r\nYou can also install the map from in-game by navigating to Play > Singleplayer > Curated and clicking subscribe, or searching for \"Rio de Janeiro\" on the server list. After Steam finishes downloading the map, Unturned will detect it and install the map without needing to restart.\r\n\r\nGoing forward curated maps are being distributed through the workshop - more details in the previous 3.30.5.0 update notes. This Rio section is at the bottom of the update notes because at the time of writing the map is featured prominently at the top of the main menu.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1565981396,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":304930},{"gid":"2412159905931036147","title":"3.30.5.0 Update Notes","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2412159905931036147","is_external_url":true,"author":"SDGNelson","contents":"[h1]Curated Maps:[/h1]\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this from the in-game menu within a week or two of the update coming out then you can see that Rio is featured above! \r\n\r\nIn order to reduce load times and keep the installation size reasonable, curated maps have typically been transitioned to the workshop after several months. This was problematic for a variety of reasons however, such as suddenly having to subscribe to the map in order to keep its assets, or for hosts needing to switch the server to the workshop version.\r\n\r\nWith the recent improvements to the game's workshop integration (e.g. auto-detecting workshop dependencies, installing while in-game), my hope is that taking this featured article approach will improve all aspects of the curated maps system:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Creators have full control over their article and can patch / update the map without waiting for me to release a main game update.

Chance / weighting of each item are equal.\r\n[*]Mythic effect is selected from weapon-compatible set, and all effects have an equal chance of being selected. Technically these are different from the \"Mythic\" tag because they use a newer Steam feature, so they show as \"Particle\" tags in the inventory.\r\n[*]Crafting requires x1,000 salvaged materials. This is an insane amount, and might be tweaked in the future. Some of the goals of mythic crafting are to improve the long-term value of your items, keep existing mythics valuable, and incentive sinking large quantities of items out of the economy, so it had to be a large amount. One factor is that inevitably bots will buy up all the 3 cent items for ~$30 per crafted mythic.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Voice Relay:[/h1]\r\n\r\nPreviously voice chat was sent from the speaker to the appropriate players using Steam's P2P network, however this had the downside of opening clients to voice packet spam, likely abused by cheats.

In recent years Unity has made stability a higher priority, and have been updating a \"long term support\" LTS version. The game is now upgraded to this 2017.4 LTS version.\r\n\r\nWhile not particularly glamorous, some of the primary motivations are:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Taking advantage of newer optimizations in the engine.\r\n[*]Removing workarounds for old unity bugs which will help improve performance.\r\n[*]Supporting the Metal graphics API for Macs now that Apple has deprecated OpenGL.\r\n[*]Fixing many longstanding issues and crashes, and continuing to get the LTS fixes going forward.\r\n[/list]\r\nThe downside is that workshop content will need to be upgraded to this new Unity version as well. I don't take this lightly, this engine transition has been in the works on and off since early 2018 and I don't want it to be painful for devs, so I've worked to make is as easy as possible detailed below.\r\n\r\nIf you want to continue playing some workshop mods that haven't been updated yet, you can opt-into the previous version (3.27.2.1) from Unturned > Properties > Betas > unity-5.5. This older version will remain available indefinitely similar to the antique and classic branches.\r\n\r\n[h1]Workshop Devs:[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]For mappers:[/b]\r\n\r\nMaps with a /Bundles folder will be detected by the game as requiring an engine update, but other maps without custom content are unaffected.\r\n\r\n[b]For translators:[/b]\r\n\r\nTranslations and localization are not affected by the engine update.\r\n\r\n[b]For content creators:[/b]\r\n\r\nGood news: there's a new tool to make bulk-exporting the .unity3d asset bundles much faster. I've updated all of the vanilla content to use this new system so I had to go through it as well, and Vilespring was kind enough to update all of the France bundles.\r\n\r\nI've written up a guide which explains in-depth how to transition your content from 5.5 to 2017.4 LTS. Feel free to post questions and I'll update it accordingly!\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1624005178]Unity Upgrade Guide[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]For programmers:[/b]\r\n\r\nThe LTS version experimentally supports .NET 4.6 which seems to be working correctly in vanilla and rocketmod plugins, but this may be rolled back if unfixable issues related to it pop up.\r\n\r\n[h1]3.28.0.1 Patch:[/h1]\r\n\r\nIncredibly, the majority of issues in the initial update were caused by the use of decimal points vs commas. Due to a change in how .NET read fractional numbers, all of them were set to 0 for players in cultures that use commas!

By requiring a detonator, detonators now have an economy sink.\r\n[*]Machine guns that damaged bases with low caliber ammunition were too powerful, and in general damage against bases is lower.\r\n[*]Metal elements are significantly more worthwhile to build, while charges still feel effective against wooden bases. Requiring multiple charges to destroy a single wooden wall felt frustrating, but that may be adjusted later.\r\n[*]By reducing the availability of raiding equipment the default base armor multipliers hopefully can stay similar, but if needed the default values will be further tuned.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Patch Notes:[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Additions:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Accepted several new time-limited skins to the stockpile from the curated workshop.\r\n[*]Added separate low and high-tier armor multipliers for buildables. Metal and bricks qualify as high-tier, and now have 2x effective health.\r\n[*]Added freeform glass plates craftable from glass windows. [IDs 892-894]\r\n[*]Added support for explanation message to server shutdown notice.\r\n[*]Added compatibility warnings for future workshop items using 2017.4 LTS.\r\n[*]Added weak grenade throw to secondary attack, and Strong_Throw_Force [1100], Weak_Throw_Force [600] and Boost_Throw_Force_Multiplier [1.4] to per-throwable configs. Previous throw force was 750 with a 2x boost multiplier.\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Tweaks:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Tweaked Nykorev, Hell's Fury and Dragonfang to only take highcal ammo, and their buildable damage slightly lower.\r\n[*]Tweaked Ekho, Matamorez, Grizzly and Timberwolf buildable damage slightly lower.\r\n[*]Tweaked horde beacon drops to scale by the square root of number of participants, rather than linearly. For example 2 players get ~1.41x, 3 players get ~1.73x.\r\n[*]Tweaked horde beacon blueprint to require sacrificing a detonator.\r\n[*]Tweaked to require text confirmation when salvaging items unless CTRL is held.

This has been a labor of love for them, a passion project that they continued polishing until they felt it was perfect - originally slated for the end of August, they delayed it to continue adding that extra touch.\r\n\r\nFrance is also the first map to take advantage of several features added for it during its early development. For example, having both snow and temperate climates in different regions across the map.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support this team's work consider checking out the France bundles on the Stockpile here: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/304930/browse/?filter=New]View NEW France Items[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/6119952/4d21d00d227bba36ca45e7c4ac350dd7a76bd3ba.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThey've also put together a quick teaser overview of the map here: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVC5q9E4tAI&feature=youtu.be]View France Map Trailer[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Update Notes:[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Additions:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Added MasterBundleTool.cs to Sources/Tools/ and converted Hawaii + Greece to use it.\r\n[*]Added Only_Critical_Stuns mode config option which only stuns zombies when back-stabbing or power-attacking.\r\n[*]Added per-magazine Ballistic_Damage_Multiplier option.\r\n[*]Added Infinite_Ammo: true/false option for turrets.\r\n[*]Added Tire_ID option for cars to require specific tire item.\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Tweaks:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Tweaked zombie stun overrides to work for guns.\r\n[*]Tweaked crafting button placement and disabled label.\r\n[*]Tweaked vanilla maps to enforce object hash.\r\n[*]Tweaked umbrellas to only take effect after fully equipping.\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Fixes:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fixed out-of-bounds check in rounded level corners.\r\n[*]Fixed kill volumes when player armor multiplier is < 1, and for vehicle passengers.\r\n[*]Fixed out-of-level zombies.\r\n[*]Fixed stuck getting back into menu when featured workshop description was misformatted.\r\n[*]Fixed logging into server at the same time as dying.\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Important news for workshop creators:[/h1]\r\n\r\nSometime before the end of January 2019 I will need to update Unturned to Unity 2017.4 LTS. When that happens, the new version will be available on a beta branch for a couple weeks before transition to the default release branch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this will have the side effect of requiring workshop content to be re-bundled using the new version of Unity, so to make that a less painful process as well as for performance improvements I've introduced a new feature: Master Bundles\r\n\r\nMaster Bundles allow content (textures, meshes, audio, etc) for multiple game assets to be bundled at the same time, rather than into individual .unity3d files. (This is probably how it should have been in the first place, but anyway...) While slower to build, they have the benefit of updating many bundles at once, and are more RAM-efficient because any common files between the bundles are shared rather than duplicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Unturned finds a MasterBundle.dat file it will assume all child folders are using this bundle with paths relative to the .dat file, unless Exclude_From_Master_Bundle is specified in the individual asset .dat file. For an example of this, check out the Greece/Bundles and Hawaii/Bundles folders.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of this change is that it will be easier to separate some maps from the game to free up space for more future maps. Specifically, I'm planning to move Hawaii + Germany and then Greece + Cyprus, to the workshop rather than in the main download in a future update. All Germany assets will continue to be bundled with the game, only the map itself will be moved. Hawaii and Greece assets will be available as a separate download on the workshop for maps which would like to add them as a dependency.\r\n\r\nTrying out this feature at least for the performance benefits is definitely encouraged. Simply copy MasterBundleTool.cs and MasterBundleHelper.cs to your Assets/Editor folder. Let me know if you run into any issues! Note that per-platform bundles (multiplatform checkbox) are supported in-case of special shaders, but generally shouldn't be needed.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1543002231,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":304930},{"gid":"2403127338437621085","title":"3.26.4.0 Update Notes","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2403127338437621085","is_external_url":true,"author":"SDGNelson","contents":"[h1]Halloween:[/h1]\r\n\r\nHalloween gift presents are dropping, decorations are up and costumes are on - the annual Halloween event is back from the grave!

It was quick and fun to do, and features stuff like the reload key fading from green to red or everything flashing white when you're flashbanged. I'm curious to hear if you have any suggestions/ideas on this.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1537633124,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":304930},{"gid":"2447032995770708001","title":"3.26.2.0 Update Notes","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2447032995770708001","is_external_url":true,"author":"SDGNelson","contents":"[h1]Update Notes:[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Additions:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Added timer and alerts when someone is leaving a group.\r\n[*]Added several timed curated workshop skins.\r\n[*]Added vehicle damaged event, item equip/dequip request event and player speed multiplier for plugins.\r\n[*]Added ability for server to respond to custom UI button clicks.
