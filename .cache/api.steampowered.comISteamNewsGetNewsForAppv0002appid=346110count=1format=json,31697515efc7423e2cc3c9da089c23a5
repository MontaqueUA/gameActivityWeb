We have a pretty interesting range of mod types this time for creatures and a utility mod for builders!\n\n\n[b][u]Clockwork Creatures[/u][/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819883361\n\t\nMechanical steampunk beasts are on the loose! If you are a fan of the steampunk aesthetic, check out this mod which adds a range of new creatures to the game, with more brass than you can shake a stick at.\n\n\n[b][u]ARK Transcendence[/u][/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1785800853\n\t\nDo you wish that ARKs creatures had a bit more personality to them? This mod introduces new behaviors to the natural residents of the ARK. The number of creatures it modifies right now is relatively small, but the author is working to expand that.\n\n\n[b][u]Structure Saver 2[/u][/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1757259514\n\t\nJust got done building the perfect house and then found a better place to build? Maybe you just want ten more of that house?\nThis mod will let you do that, allowing players to save constructions and place them elsewhere.\n\t\nHappy Modding!\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567726835,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":346110,"tags":["workshop"]}],"count":481}}
