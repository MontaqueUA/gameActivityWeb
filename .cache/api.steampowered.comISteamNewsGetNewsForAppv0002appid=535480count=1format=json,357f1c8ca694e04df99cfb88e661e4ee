We’re super stoked to finally reveal the project we’ve been lovingly crafting over the past 18 months or so. Behold [i]Spiritfarer[/i]: a cozy management game about dying.\r\n\r\nQueue our first trailer and prepare thyselves for the feels!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnuEvePlxWI\r\n\r\n[i]Spiritfarer [/i]is a project that’s near and dear to our hearts. Here’s the basic pitch:\r\n\r\nIn [i]Spiritfarer[/i], you play Stella, ferrymaster to the deceased. Build a boat to explore the world, then befriend and care for spirits before finally releasing them into the afterlife. Farm, mine, fish, harvest, cook, and craft your way across mystical seas. Join the adventure as Daffodil the cat, in two-player cooperative play. Spend relaxing quality time with your spirit passengers, create lasting memories, and, ultimately, learn how to say goodbye to your cherished friends.\r\n\r\nExpect a release next year on Steam, as well as with Xbox Game Pass for PC and Console, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch!\r\n\r\nWe can’t wait to tell you more about the game over the next few days, weeks, and months.\r\n\r\nToday, as I write this, we’re enjoying the frenzy of [b]E3 2019[/b], where we’ve been invited by the good people at Microsoft to present the first playable demo of [i]Spiritfarer [/i]as part of their E3 activities. Come say hi at the Microsoft Theater if you’re in town for the convention! If not, maybe we’re coming to another con near you over the next few months, hmm? \r\n\r\nStay tuned (and do please [b]Follow [/b]or Wishlist [i]Spiritfarer[/i])!\r\n\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/972660/Spiritfarer/\r\n\r\nBack to you soon with more Spiritfarer news!\r\n\r\nCheers y’all,\r\n\r\n– Rodrigue and the Thunder Lotus team","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1560118618,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":535480}],"count":40}}
