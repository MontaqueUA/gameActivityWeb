United under the banner of Caffeine &#8211; a &#8220;social broadcasting platform for gaming&#8221;, not the life-giving stimulant &#8211; there&#8217;s eight games here, each one representing a wildly different genre.

I made a game called GoNNER together with my two friends Martin and Joar. GoNNER won an Independent Games Festival award in Audio Design a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nLike, real talk, this is really fucking weird. The IGF means so incredibly much to us, so winning one doesn't feel real. It's an incredible honor. Thank you. \r\n\r\nMe, Martin and Joar tried to have as much fun as we could while making a game together. The whole project actually started when Martin asked me if this strange little platformer I was working on needed sounds. He figured he wouldn't have to make footstep sounds because of the way the game looked, Martin hates making footstep sounds. Joar and I once jammed and made 10 songs each in an hour, 3 of those are actually in the game today. Martin would sometimes send me a folder of literally hundreds of sound effects and then tell me \"do something fun with these!\". Our process was always about surprising and challenging each other creatively while having as much fun as possible. If we ever had a tough decision to make, the option that made us smile would be the one we chose. It makes me really happy to see that the fun we had while making it shines through in the game!\r\n\r\nWe're honestly still trying to process the whole IGF thing. Wow!\r\n\r\nBut it's not over! In fact, nothing is ever over, after all, we're living in a looped reality where nothing really disappears, it just changes. GoNNER is changing too! Slightly! We're working hard on a nice update that is coming out .. SOON!! I'm getting a lot of complaints that the game is too easy, so we're adding a bunch of new enemies that will make the game even harder for hardcore players. I'm not even a little sorry. <3\r\n\r\nOh and hey, while I've still got your attention. GoNNER is coming out on Nintendo Switch. Yep, really! You'll be able to bring GoNNER with you on your Switch while riding a train, going to hipster parties or whatever it is people do outside their homes.

There are a couple of categories like [b]\"I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\"[/b] and [b]\"Just 5 More Minutes\"[/b] that could fit here. Or maybe you can nominate it for best space whale in the [b]\"We Didn't Think of Everything\"[/b] category.\r\n\r\nObviously, the choice is yours and you're free to do what you want.

WOAH! \r\n\r\nBlack Friday is coming up, and to celebrate consumerism we've added two new heads to GoNNER!! They're hidden pretty well though, so you'll have to search carefully! \r\n\r\nI've also added VSync to the graphics options, hoping the game will run a bit smoother for more people now! \r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] VSync! Woah! SMOOTH FPS INCOMING??? \r\n[*] Invisible ceiling to open levels. No more flying forever. \r\n[*][spoiler]Pyramid[/spoiler] head: [spoiler]shorter backpack cooldowns!

I've recently started experimenting with some super professional shaders and stuff. I didn't want to go overboard, so the changes are pretty subtle but it turned out super smooth! Hope you like it! \r\n\r\nOn top of that, there's now friendly ghosts! They're really helpful. There are 3 different ones in total, but you can only have one ghost following you at a time.

I try to upload a new update every week by the way! WOAH! \r\n\r\nThis week I've added a little something to the daily challenge, a friendly [spoiler]fairy-ghost-spirit-thingy[/spoiler]! It'll help you [spoiler]keep track [/spoiler]of your [spoiler]gear[/spoiler]! Sweet! In a future update these will pop up in the main game, there's even going to be different kinds with different abilities! But until everything works as intended you can at least get a first feel for it in the Daily. \r\n\r\nApart from that this week's got a bunch of nice polish and balance: \r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]There's an extra tutorial level in the \"intro\", and you can now play the intro from the main menu! \r\n[*]Camera mode, available in the gameplay options! If you dislike the camera, you can make it stop trying to be fancy now! NICE! \r\n[*]A minor fix to input handling. Hopefully more devices should work now! \r\n[*]A fancy controls display in the splash screen! \r\n[*]Sharkfin now gets deactivated when jumping through a World Snake.\r\n[*]Grey [spoiler]Bopskulls (the skull enemies in Death World that get grey if you kill enough of them.)[/spoiler] no longer award combo.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThat's it for this week, next week I hope to have the [spoiler]Fairy Merchant[/spoiler] in the main game!!

HI! HELLO! \r\n\r\nWe're happy to announce a pretty hefty update to the game! Most notably is a big amount of optimization, hopefully resulting in stable 60 fps for a lot more players. Even more notable is the addition of a new gosh darned WEAPON? WOAH!!  \r\n\r\nAlright, bullet points time!!!\r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay changes: [/b][list] \r\n[*] A NEW MELEE BASED WEAPON, THE SCYTHE! I'm so excited about this one, we've been talking about melee since the first months of development but never got around to implementing one. FINALLY! \r\n[*] The Daily Challenge levels have been updated with some more layout variations. \r\n[*] The merchant now decorates his little hangout with lamps ... or mushrooms ... What are those things anyways? This game is really confusing. \r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Bug fixes: [/b][list]\r\n[*] Fixed a clipping issue that let you move through walls while inside the World Snake butt when entering a new level. \r\n[*] The merchant in [spoiler]Deathworld[/spoiler] now stands on the ground like a normal person, instead of hiding outside of the level. \r\n[*] Fixed a bug that allowed permanent invincibility with the [spoiler]Godbox[/spoiler]. \r\n[*] The leaderboards should now display \"Nothing to show\" if you don't have an entry yet, instead of \"loading\" forever. \r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Performance improvements: [/b][list]\r\n[*] Game now soft caps at 60 fps, which should allow for smoother fps in general. \r\n[*] Fixed a memory leak caused by sound sources. Should have a massive impact on performance! \r\n[*] Reduced the amount of server calls to Steam.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nFinally, here's a little hint on how to unlock the scythe: \r\n[spoiler] It's VERY expensive.[/spoiler]","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1478182450,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":437570}],"count":31}}
