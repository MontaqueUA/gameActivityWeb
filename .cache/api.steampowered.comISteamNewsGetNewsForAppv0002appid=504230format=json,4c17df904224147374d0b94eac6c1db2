Well, not too soon, because according to developer Matt Thorson it won&#x2019;t be ready for the game&#x2019;s anniversary on January 25th, as he&#x2019;d hoped. In a post on Twitter, Thorson did confirm that the coming levels are are a continuous chapter harder than the current hardest levels in the game. The new levels won&#x2019;t have strawberries, the hard-to-find collectibles that players must hunt down throughout the game in order to change the ending.

A strong narrative is what keeps players in the game, rather than the adrenaline high of pushing their skills to the limit.

Just before Celeste released, Berry said that Skytorn <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/2d-post-apocalyptic-adventure-skytorn-will-return-dev-says/\" target=\"_blank\">wasn&apos;t dead, and that the team would finish it off</a> in the future. But that plan has now changed&#x2014;in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@NoelFB/skytorn-is-cancelled-d40c5d9d35e5\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> this week, he revealed that the team has abandoned Skytorn, largely because they &quot;just never figured out what it was&quot;.</p><p>The game was &quot;broken&quot; at its core, Berry said: it was a procedurally-generated adventure game without permadeath, which &quot;clashed&quot; with the Metroidvania themes.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;Taking out the procedural parts felt like it defeated the purpose of what the game was, so as it shifted towards a more linear adventure, the procedural map stayed but simply got more and more constricted, until the procedural-ness of it didn&#x2019;t really mean anything&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;it was just&#x2026; there,&quot; he said.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;And this is a lot of overhead for basically no payoff. Why make a procedural game at all if you don&#x2019;t really get the benefits of it being procedural?&quot; Finishing Skytorn would require the team to &quot;throw away a lot of the code and gameplay design&quot;, he said, which he and others weren&apos;t prepared to do.</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m really sorry for those of you who were excited about this game. We were too. We poured a lot of time, energy, and heart into the project and we&#x2019;re definitely sad it&#x2019;s never going to see the commercial release we were hoping for.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>You can watch some 2016 gameplay of Skytorn below.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hx8EkoqDG_M\"></iframe>\n<p>Lastly, Berry said that the Celeste team would be &quot;sticking together&quot;, and would share news about their next game in the new year.
