We were working on another major update, which we are releasing today. Many of you have participated on our public tests, so you probably know that the update is about the new economy system we are bringing into the game. Regarding existing feature polish, we have addressed a record amount of long term issues and bugs, so many thanks to our incredible community for their continuous support and patience. There really is something for everyone in this update!\r\n\r\nAll new game features related to the economy are free of charge. The free update includes the economy code updates, the safe zones, all the contract features and long term fixes. For players who wish to support the further development of Space Engineers, we have created a Pack which consists of cosmetic items designed to enrich your game. The price of the Economy Deluxe pack is $3.99USD, or your regional Steam equivalent. So if you wish to support us, check out the Economy Deluxe Pack on Steam.\r\n\r\nMain features\r\n[list]\r\n[*]NPC Trading Stations - AI controlled store and contracts\r\n[*]Contracts - generated and player made\r\n[*]New Blocks - Store, Contracts, and Safe Zone\r\n[*]New items - Datapad, Zone Chip\r\n[*]Faction Reputation\r\n[*]Ingame Currency - Space Credits\r\n[*]Player to Player Trading\r\n[*]New Admin Tools Features - for trash cleaner and for economy\r\n[*]Consumables - Medkit and Powerkit\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz9JdUfmQO4\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1135960\r\nMarek's blog post: https://blog.marekrosa.org/2019/08/space-engineers-economy-update.html\r\nFull list of features and improvements: https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/7403364","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1566493748,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":244850,"tags":["patchnotes"]},{"gid":"3556075649734421466","title":"Announcing the Economy Update  DLC Release Date!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/3556075649734421466","is_external_url":true,"author":"Blitzzz333","contents":"[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/5134093/0dda1e088c1ba1ba0a68d12c9eac490a9c0cc456.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]We‚Äôre releasing the Space Engineers Economy Update & DLC on Thursday, August, 22nd, 2019.

We have been very busy since the release of Space Engineers from Early Access. We continued working on the game improvements and in this update we focused on a new feature: Build Planner, and one new block: Small Cryo Pod and on customizable game elements, such as skins, emotes and armor skins.\r\nThe Build Planner feature allows players to create a list of blocks or components, which can be automatically transferred into their inventory. It significantly simplifies the gameplay and we are sure that you will appreciate it. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDAF1GYeqlw\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1084680/Space_Engineers__Style_Pack/\r\nMarek's blog post: https://blog.marekrosa.org/2019/06/space-engineers-build-planner-small.html\r\nFull list of features and improvements: https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/7403193\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1559841564,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":244850,"tags":["patchnotes"]},{"gid":"2411028931139595545","title":"Space Engineers - Video Competition 2019 Compilation","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2411028931139595545","is_external_url":true,"author":"Blitzzz333","contents":"[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/5134093/3a346c7f68ba42ad8efdfa9204c4a0ac15cd9f60.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWe were blown away by the submissions we received for the Space Engineers Video Competition, so we thought we‚Äôd create this compilation to celebrate our community‚Äôs passion and talent.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNbks2G-tZQ\r\n\r\nEnjoy ÀêsteamhappyÀê","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1559820448,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":244850},{"gid":"2411028931137134138","title":"Wastes of Space: A Space Engineers Diary Part Six: Secrets of the Ants","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2411028931137134138","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (RPS)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/06/wastes-of-space-jacked-up.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/06/wastes-of-space-jacked-up.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a><em><strong>Last time on Wastes of Space</strong>: In need of a mobile base, the gang started building a colossal metal spider called the </em><em>Loveless</em>, in homage to Commander Bee&#8217;s favourite film.
