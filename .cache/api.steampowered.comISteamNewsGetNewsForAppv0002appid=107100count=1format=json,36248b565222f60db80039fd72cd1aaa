Check out our new 'Coming Soon' page for Hades, and hit the [b]Add to your wishlist[/b] button for a handy reminder once it's out.\r\n\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/\r\n\r\n[h1]About the game[/h1]\r\n[i][b]Hades[/b][/i] is a rogue-like dungeon crawler that combines the best aspects of our previous games, including the fast-paced action of [i][b]Bastion[/b][/i], the rich atmosphere and depth of [i][b]Transistor[/b][/i], and the character-driven storytelling of [i][b]Pyre[/b][/i]. As the immortal Prince of the Underworld, you'll wield the powers and mythic weapons of Olympus as you hack and slash your way free from the clutches of the god of death himself, while growing stronger and unraveling more of the story with each unique escape attempt.\r\n \r\n[h1]About our Early Access[/h1]\r\nEarly Access means you can play [i][b]Hades[/b][/i] while it's still in active development. We expect to be in Early Access till sometime in the second half of 2020.\r\n\r\nWe designed [i][b]Hades[/b][/i] as an Early Access game from the ground up. Our foremost goal was to see if we could create something great in partnership with our community -- a game that was true to our values about design, worldbuilding, and storytelling, and could naturally evolve based on the feedback we'd get along the way. Every aspect of the game, from its modular structure to its approach to narrative, flow from this idea.\r\n\r\nWe're really looking forward to hearing your impressions and feedback. In the mean time, please visit our Hades page to learn more, and we'll see you soon!","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1566495611,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":107100}],"count":103}}
