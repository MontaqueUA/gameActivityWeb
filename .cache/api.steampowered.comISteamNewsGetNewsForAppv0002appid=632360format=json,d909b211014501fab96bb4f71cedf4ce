[/b]Thanks to their fantastic efforts, we’ve been able to turn around a console release very quickly.\r\n\r\nA unique challenge that we’re facing is that Early Access games don’t really exist on all the consoles. To help smooth over that confusion, we are launching a console-specific roadmap, outlining the timeline of when the consoles will be updated to match the PC version of the game. Note- the PC roadmap remains the same and we will maintain two roadmaps (see below).\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/028af2a3f59029c8ab0dc2fbeddd054d9d9389b1.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nOutlined below is our intended development plan for Content Updates (CU) going forward:\r\n\r\n-Hopoo Games begins and develops the CU\r\n-Submit to Gearbox QA once the CU is content locked\r\n-Launch the CU on PC\r\n-Address any Week 1 feedback + bugs with a small patch\r\n\r\nAfter the first week is over and we’ve gathered all the information and feedback we can, we then share everything with PlayEveryWare for the consoles.\r\n\r\n-Submit our Content Update + Week 1 Patch to PlayEveryWare\r\n-PlayEveryWare takes over to begin porting the CU for Switch, Xbox One, and PS4\r\n-Submit console version to QA\r\n-Pass certification on Switch, Xbox One, and PS4\r\n-Release on all consoles simultaneously\r\n\r\n[b]Our intent is to turn around Content Updates as soon as we can for consoles[/b]. Not only that, but consoles will get some features specific to its hardware that will also be included in the roadmap as it grows - ad hoc multiplayer for the Switch as an example. We’re also keeping our ears to the ground to make sure that the console version of the game is of the same quality as the PC version - [b]please let us know if you run into any issues![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]=== Risk of Rain for Xbox One ===[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/6a9c6a2a3e0d9f13a9a4856f505850147e84c871.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, fans of Risk of Rain will also be happy to know that the original Risk of Rain has been ported to Xbox One, and can be purchased as a bundle along side RoR2. We are thrilled to bring the Risk of Rain universe to the Xbox Community for the first time. Check it out!\r\n\r\n[b]=== September Content Update ===[/b]\r\n\r\nFor our PC Risk of Rain 2 community, don’t worry! PlayEveryWare and Gearbox have done a fantastic job sandboxing the development of the consoles, meaning that[b] internally we’ve spent all of our time working on our next Content Update[/b], slated to come out in [b]September[/b]. We’re very proud of the next update - including Skills 2.0 - that we will show off as soon as all the madness from console launch settles down. Our September update ended up a lot larger than we previously anticipated, and we hope you will enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/2b580d1d4ad4ff3149891708a4fdd1b621e74c05.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/baf8ecb455f74bd67c69355aca7c69d5fc1fd17c.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’re all excited for the future of Risk of Rain 2, and we hope that the console release is another step towards reaching out to fans across the world. Thanks again to everyone who’s supported us - and to all our new fans, we hope you enjoy your stay. \r\n\r\n-Hopoo Games Team\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567203682,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":632360},{"gid":"3556075649733789430","title":"Risk of Rain 2 coming to Nintendo Switch this summer","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/3556075649733789430","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-08-19-14-17/-1566220672587.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2053591.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>The first announcement of the Nintendo Indie World Presentation is a great one: Risk of Rain 2 is headed to Nintendo Switch this summer.</p><p>Risk of Rain 2 is a third-person roguelike shooter developed by Hopoo Games, where you play as one of 10 unique characters with up to four friends, battling through different stages to collect items and make yourself stronger.</p><p>It's currently in early access on Steam with only five characters available to play so far, and is expected to stay in early access for a few months yet.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-19-risk-of-rain-2-coming-to-switch-this-summer\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1566224340,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":632360},{"gid":"3364670677182394267","title":"Hopoo Games Development Thoughts #6","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/3364670677182394267","is_external_url":true,"author":"Huntress","contents":"Hi!\r\n\r\nAs we work between major Content Updates, we still want to make sure we're communicating with our fans. While there isn't a whole ton to talk about, we will try our best to make sure everyone knows we have not died (yet).\r\n\r\n== [b]Development Progress[/b] ==\r\n\r\nInternally, our September content update is chugging along great, and is slated to be better than Scorched Acres (in my opinion :))\r\n\r\nThe feedback from the community on the types of content and how much of each different content style we added were great to hear. We want to continue our next content in a similar fashion by adding another character, stage, map, monster, items and lots of achievements along with Skills 2.0!\r\n\r\nThis Update is also refreshing coming off of Scorched Acres because it contains some recurring content from Risk of Rain 1, as shown below. I wonder who could the next survivor be...? (hint: it's not the Miner)\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/27bbccb8e0154ce7418a0a985060ea80401b9e7d.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWe're also doing a bit of reviewing of how the Scorched Acres update went overall. We are looking at how things improved (new content!), but also at some things did not (no longer guaranteeing Rally Point Delta makes it frustrating to try to earn the Preon Accumulator). We will spend time doing more QoL and improvements on previous content in our next update as well. We want to make sure that all content lives up to the high standard we have set since launching in Early Access.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but players have had enough time to test content, and we have a better idea of not only what's balanced, but what's enjoyable.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/63c747f3424650128d7bf5a3dea307f7be483088.png[/img]\r\n\r\n== [b]Skills 2.0[/b] ==\r\n\r\nWe have been very hard at work at \"Skills 2.0\" teased in our roadmap, and a lot of people have been wondering what that means for their favorite characters. While the system is still in progress, we know this!\r\n\r\nOur main design goals with Skills 2.0 are to:\r\n1. Give players a reason to play other characters they might not normally pick, or return to old characters\r\n2. Give players who REALLY love and are proficient at a certain character a way to earn some in-game rewards\r\n\r\nThis is based on feedback that we've seen from the Community since launch. We will provide a full run-down on this as we get closer to September!\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/7e30e7598d63b4445ac2a7f601c09db24dcca9bd.png[/img]\r\n\r\n== [b]Modding[/b] ==\r\n\r\nIt's no secret that Risk of Rain 2 has fostered an absolutely [i]awesome[/i] modding community. While we have no direct mod support, our intent is to avoid breaking mods with our updates, and to not do any changes that would hamper the community. Maybe you'll see us popping into the modding community in the future! \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in Risk of Rain 2 modding, check out the Thunderstore to see the awesome content people have already been making![i] As always when modding ANY game, please download and install mods at your own risk! We can't check every mod that gets uploaded or guarantee that they are safe and won't break your save files.[/i]\r\n\r\nCheck it out here! [url=https://thunderstore.io/]https://thunderstore.io/[/url]\r\n\r\n[i]NOTE: We will be releasing an updated EULA for RoR2 very soon. The ONLY intent for this EULA is to make sure that if modders make content (like say, a returning Survivor), we aren't locked out of making similar content in the future. For the modding community: please actually read the EULA, and PLEASE let us know if this is not reflected in what we wrote. We know a lot of companies sneak stuff into their EULA, and that truly is not the intent here.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry if this sounds like \"Soon TM hehe\" and that there isn't very much concrete information, but I hope some people enjoy this post anyways.

This was a big nervous moment for us internally, since it essentially sets the pace for the rest of Early Access.\r\n\r\nOverall we're very happy with the balance and design of the content we included, and we're glad the community feels that way too! There are a lot of moving parts with each Content Update, so we're keeping our ears to the ground for anything that felt like it moved too much.\r\n\r\nWith the release of Scorched Acres, our Roadmap has now progressed forward! Our next update lands in September - and it's [i]loaded[/i] with content. Check it out below:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33906904/8d2ba44cb61c9a78c4d08d17dd56f14113700404.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n===**[b]Major Points[/b]**===\r\n• Very excited about REX's reception! We're seeing a lot of polarizing views, which is super awesome and exciting. We don't want everyone to feel like he's good or bad.\r\n• Barrier as a concept seems well recieved. It will be a great tool going forward to help us design defensive items that don't give permanent sustain like healing does.\r\n• We noticed a change in spawn frequency - and presumably the difficulty of the game. While this was unintended, we're going to wait to see how it all plays out to see if it's for the best - Monsoon in RoR2 always felt like it was a bit easier than Monsoon in RoR1. It is also possible the game is more difficult because of the fix on critical strikes dealing multiplicative stacking damage, resulting in more enemies piling up. \r\n• People seem to think the Brooch is OP, which it might be, but that's OK\r\n• Malachite enemies are scary - which is perfect. Whether or not the anti-heal debuff is on needs to be more clear, with maybe a screen overlay.\r\n• We aren't planning on touching balance with the next patch. We want to see how things shake out, and to give players enough time to learn what enemies and items are strong before we change it all around again.\r\n\r\n\r\n===**[b]Minor Points[/b]**===\r\n• Cave TP spawns in Abyssal Depths can be very difficult - keeping an eye on that\r\n• The possibility of the permanent uptime on Spinel Tonic was intended by design - the combination seems difficult enough to assemble currently, and is thematically awesome enough to try to preserve\r\n• People are starting to see how strong the new proc math is. Starting to feel that the visual cap of 9999 damage may be too low.\r\n• Enemies are feeling a bit bullet-spongy, which most likey is a result of the crit fix. We don't really want things to ever be spongey, so we're watching to make sure the late-game experience is still enjoyable.\r\n• Surprised not a lot of people are utilizing REX's Shift to shove things off the edge of maps\r\n• Noticing some performance issues, possibly related to the higher spawn count\r\n\r\n\r\n===**[b]Stuff we are working on[/b]**===\r\n• Mercenary's Blinding Assault having issues with double cooldowns\r\n• Fuel Array behavior being mistaken for Sticky Bomb\r\n• Everything turning Pink and Invisible\r\n• Some other small bugs that we caught in the week of Scorched Acres' release\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again for joining us on this journey.

Thank you all so much - we feel very lucky.\r\n\r\nLast week we released our Content Roadmap, and the initial response has been overwhelmingly positive.

This update is particularly exciting for us because [b]ALL of the content included in our first update will be new content to the Risk of Rain universe.[/b] Expect a brand-new survivor, map, and more. If you’re a RoR1 fan and you miss some RoR1 survivors - don’t give up yet.

We have lots of exciting news that we will be sharing - lets dive in!\r\n\r\n[i]NOTE: Developer Thoughts is a way for us to touch base with the community - consider these to be candid thoughts from the development team. We will be breaking down our thoughts into Major and Minor Points, along with things we have been working on internally. A lot of these are community suggestions coming from emails, Discord, Twitter and other sources - thank you all again for being so active in the Risk of Rain 2 community!   [/i]\r\n\r\n[h1][b]===**Major Points**===[/b][/h1]\r\n• Content Roadmap - players understandably wanted to know the cadence and size of content updates throughout Early Access, and we hope the “forecast” image matches those wants. We will provide details about specific updates as we get closer to their respective release. \r\n• Official Localization - it has been inspiring to see community localization efforts and a playerbase around the world, so we’re working on adding official localization in the next patch\r\n• Gilded Coast is unclear and unrewarding to most players.\r\n• Game stutters when picking up items for the first time.\r\n• Some players are still being affected by save file corruption, especially if the game shuts down unexpectedly via crash or power issues.\r\n• Noting some players having trouble readying up in multiplayer and private games.\r\n• Noting sometimes settings are reset after closing and relaunching the game.\r\n\r\n[h1][b]===**Minor Points**===[/b][/h1]\r\n• The changes made to blazing affixed monsters seem to be positive and feel more balanced.\r\n• The changes made to freezing affixes are welcome - a good sign!\r\n• Some users are still getting really low performance, while some are not.\r\n• Noting the Mercenary sometimes launches Greater Wisps / Brass Contraptions into space.\r\n• Noting players want the number of Stages Complete displayed on the HUD.\r\n• Noting general feedback about drone / TC-280 AI needing to be improved.\r\n• Noting players want to include the Engineer turret damage into the end report screen.\r\n• The game should ideally keep the difficulty that was chosen in the character select for the next run.\r\n• Noting player thoughts about specific white items (APR Rounds, Medkit, etc) feeling weak. Will have to make sure the game isn't slowly power creeped by continually buffing underperforming items.\r\n• Specific controller setups are missing glyphs.\r\n\r\n[h1][b]===**Stuff we are working on**===[/b][/h1]\r\n• Our first content update!\r\n• Official Language support for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Turkish.\r\n• Updating the Director to make sure monsters don't stop spawning late into the game.\r\n• Preventing monsters and bosses from spawning behind closed gates on certain stages.\r\n• Pinging issues.\r\n• Gesture of the Drowned firing equipment every frame.\r\n• Wake of Vultures granting weird overshields.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, please let us know if we missed anything! We are really excited to support our international fans, and we hope that the localization efforts are a good start. We also hope the Roadmap matches everyone's expectations - please let us know if it missed the mark. We intend the Roadmap to be an active part of development, and will be updating it as we get closer to major milestones.

And then later this summer. And again in the fall, the winter, and spring 2020, when developers Hopoo Games say it will launch out of Early Access. After a hell of a successful first month, the team posted an update this Friday covering what&apos;s coming next and laid out an Early Access roadmap leading up to version 1.0. Expect new items and equipment in every single update, along with three new characters before next spring, more stages, and &quot;Skills 2.0&quot; and &quot;Artifact 2.0&quot; features.</p><p>&quot;We are sharing this forecast so players know what to look forward to and what the team is working towards in making Risk of Rain 2 the best game of its kind,&quot; Hopoo&apos;s Paul Morse said in a press release about the Early Access roadmap.&#xA0;</p><p>The June update promises a new character, stage, and boss, while summer promises the first major addition, Skills 2.0, with no breakdown of what that means. Artifacts, meanwhile, aka modifiers that change the difficulty and how the game plays, won&apos;t be coming until the winter update.</p><p>I&apos;m most curious about Fall&apos;s &quot;Hidden Realms&quot; update, which sounds like it&apos;ll include some secret levels outside the standard stages. What will they do? How will we reach them? (The likely answer: Play a lot of Risk of Rain 2).</p><p>And I&apos;m excited to see which of the characters are wholly new creations, if any, or if they&apos;re all returning survivors from the first Risk of Rain. I played a lot of the Enforcer in the first game, a shotgun-and-riot-shield-wielding SWAT dude, and would be happy to see him make a comeback.</p><p>Localization is currently in progress for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Aside from their content updates, the devs have a few major points on their minds, including stamping out a save corruption bug and rooting out a stuttering problem when picking up items for the first time.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1556283615,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":632360}],"count":38}}
