Those with good memories may recall the controversy surrounding Ark's first season pass, which arose when Studio Wildcard opted to introduce paid DLC into the game well before it had left early access. It remains to be see if the community will be more accepting of a new season pass with Ark: Survival Evolved now approaching its second year as a full release.</p><p>As to what Genesis will bring in terms of specifics, that's a little harder to gauge right now. Despite being unveiled <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/464340615\" target=\"_blank\">in a 50-minute livestream</a>, the bulk of the expansions still remain firmly under wraps. What we do know, however, is that both parts will include a \"really cool map\", with the first map set within a simulation, enabling Wildcard to do things that were \"even too crazy\" for previous expansions.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-08-ark-survival-evolved-unveils-new-two-part-genesis-expansion-coming-in-december\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1565305680,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":346110},{"gid":"2412160539855300860","title":"Everything we know about Ark: Genesis","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2412160539855300860","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mgmk9MGoQtY\"></iframe>\n<p>Ark: Genesis was <a href=\"https://playark.com/genesis/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> by Studio Wildcard&#x2014;a two-part expansion pack for the multiplayer dino-survival game <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-ark-mods/\" target=\"_blank\">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>. We&apos;ve seen the announcement trailer and some screenshots, and we talked to Studio Wildcard to learn a few interesting details about the upcoming expansion.</p><p>Here&apos;s everything we know about Ark: Genesis.</p>\n<h3>Ark: Genesis release date</h3>\n<p>There are two parts to the Ark: Genesis expansion.&#xA0;</p><p>We don&apos;t have solid dates for either part yet, but as the announcement trailer above shows, we know Part One is coming in December of 2019. Part Two will follow in Winter of 2020.</p>\n<h3>Where and when does Ark: Genesis take place?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The name Genesis would seem to indicate that this expansion could be a prequel of sorts. An interesting detail from the teaser <em>could</em> hint at that: The wrist of the player isn&apos;t embedded with the specimen implant we&apos;ve always seen in Ark. However, the presence of Helena and the fact that this appears to link up with the ending of Ark: Extinction, the previous expansion, contradicts the idea of Genesis as a prequel.</p><p>In other words, we don&apos;t really know where this fits into the Ark timeline. Feel free to speculate!</p><p>As for the map that will arrive with Ark: Genesis, we can see it has some volatile volcanic regions, some snowy mountainous areas, and some more temperate biomes. There will also be an expansive water biome.</p>\n<h3>You&apos;ll have an AI companion, HLN-A</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>You won&apos;t be alone in Ark: Genesis. Helena, the biologist who authored the lore-filled explorer notes, has created a hovering AI companion designated HLN-A. Fully voiced, she&apos;ll act as a guide, providing you with missions, tasks, and story, and she&apos;ll also have practical uses as she follows you around, like illuminating dark areas.</p><p>HLN-A can also perform her own version of emotes&#x2014;as you can see in the image above, she can display a danger warning by projecting a skull and crossbones (though you probably already grasped the peril from the looks of the extremely angry creature.) She can also signal warnings for extreme heat, dangerously low temperatures, or even just give you a thumbs-up.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to wait for December to meet HLN-A. Players who pre-purchase the season pass can have her join them in Ark immediately, on any map in the game. She&apos;s not fully feature-complete yet but she can talk a bit and Studio Wildcard says she may give players bits of lore relating to Genesis as we get closer to its release date. You can also customize her looks with various dyes.</p>\n<h3>You can build a base on a giant turtle&apos;s back</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>No need to settle on one spot to build your base in Ark: Genesis. If you tame a giant sea turtle, you can build your home right on its shell. The turtle can swim around in the water biome, and even dive underwater with your base, which will be protected and oxygenated by the turtle with no need for scuba gear.</p><p>Resources will grows on the turtle&apos;s shell, so you can even do a bit of farming on your new aquatic mobile home.</p>\n<h3>What new dinosaurs will be added?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>We don&apos;t have names for all the new dinos yet, but we know a bit about them already. There&apos;s the sea turtle, obviously. There&apos;s also the giant volcanic lizard, who has a powerful AOE attack and can also spit huge lava projectiles. It will be tamable, which is great because I&apos;d much rather be friends with it than fight it.</p><p>There&apos;s also a small shoulder pet nicknamed Tiny. It&apos;s adorable until it gets its hands on some Element, one of Ark&apos;s resources, which makes it completely hulk out and turn into a vicious, rampaging multi-limbed fangbeast. Seems like just the kind of pet you&apos;d like in your arsenal.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there will be more creatures to fight and tame in Ark: Genesis, and we&apos;ll update this article as we discover them.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1565299276,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":346110},{"gid":"2412160539855249257","title":"Ark: Genesis lets you build houses on giant sea turtles","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2412160539855249257","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Emily Gera)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/f7UVveZa-690x388.jpeg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></p>\n<p>Multiplayer dinosaur-riding island-surviv-a-thon series <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/ark-survival-evolved/\">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has taken inspiration from my fever dreams and will be introducing giant sea turtles who double as islands which then double as an open construction site for your future home.</p>\n<p>The next chapter in the ongoing Ark saga, known as Ark: Genesis, will be made up of two hefty expansion packs.

There&apos;s no Ark: Survival Evolved sequel coming (yet, anyway), but Studio Wildcard has announced two new expansion packs collectively called <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/ark-genesis-season-pass-everything-we-know/\" target=\"_blank\">Ark: Genesis</a>. The first Genesis pack will arrive this December, and the other is planned for the second half of next year. You can watch the announcement trailer further down the page.</p><p>In addition to a new map, a new story, and some cool new creatures&#x2014;including a giant sea turtle you can build a damn fort on&#x2014;Ark: Genesis is adding something that&apos;s <em>not</em> a something. It&apos;s a <em>someone</em>.</p><p>&quot;For Genesis, we&apos;re actually introducing our first speaking character to Ark who&apos;s with you throughout the game, in the form of HLN-A,&quot; said Jesse Rapczak, technical art director and co-creative director of Studio Wildcard, when we talked earlier this week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>HLN-A (an acronym for Human Learning Neural Aid) is a fully-voiced floating AI companion who follows you around, talks, gives you missions and goals, and brings the story of Ark to the forefront instead of concealing it in scattered explorer notes as it has in the past. In fact, HLN-A is a reference to Helena, the biologist who authored those explorer notes and created this AI companion.</p><p>&quot;So instead of just being a sandbox survival experience,&quot; Rapczak said, &quot;Genesis takes that sandbox heritage that comes from the rest of Ark, but wraps it up with some direction on things that you would want to do to get through the story points, and tackle the final boss, and uncover the next chapters of the story we&apos;re telling.&quot;</p><p>While you&apos;ll need to wait until December to experience the first part of Genesis, the season pass is available for pre-order now and those who purchase it will immediately get access to the first version of HLN-A in Ark.&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to Rapczak, HLN-A will work on any current Ark map, follow the player around, talk and react a bit to player actions, serve as a hovering flashlight in dark areas, and perform a few other functions.&#xA0;</p><p>Over the months leading up to the release of Genesis, Rapczak said they&apos;ll probably use HLN-A to deliver little snippets of lore related to the Genesis expansion to players that have obtained her by pre-purchasing the season pass. You can still play Ark with friends who haven&apos;t pre-purchased the expansion and they&apos;ll be able to see HLN-A following you around in the game.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As for the Genesis map, it will contain a number of biomes including dangerous volcanic regions, home to the massive fire lizard you see above, and a high-altitude &quot;crazy snow mountain biome&quot; with some severe survival challenges. There&apos;s also a small, tamable shoulder pet nicknamed &quot;Tiny&quot; who completely hulks out into a rampaging monster when exposed to Element, one of Ark&apos;s crafting resources.</p><p>And, again, there will be giant sea turtles and you can build bases on their shells. You can even harvest the resources that grow on its back and use its oxygen supply when it submerges.</p><p>If you&apos;re wondering why Ark is getting yet another expansion instead of a sequel, Rapczak told me it&apos;s due to the overwheming response to the previous expansions, which has kept Ark in the top 10 most-played games on Steam for the past two years. &quot;The game has had a much longer life and enthusiasm from the community than really we could have forseen,&quot; he told me.</p><p><a href=\"https://survivetheark.com/\" target=\"_blank\">You can learn more at Ark&apos;s official site</a> or watch <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/464340615\" target=\"_blank\">the VOD of the announcement livestream</a>.

Superior hunters, they leap from a hiding place and pounce on their prey. The Deinonychus is an agile climber as well, jumping from wall ledge to wall ledge as it seeks high vantage points to lie in wait. \n\nA hungry Deinonychus tends to be fearless and will hunt prey much larger than itself, latching onto a dinosaur's back with its sickle-shaped claws, then starting to feed before its victim is even dead. While it likes its meat fresh, a Deinonychus isn't above scavenging a carcass if no other food is available. \n\n\n[b]Domesticated[/b]\nRaising a Deinonychus in captivity requires an ample food supply, as they have a fast metabolism to match their high activity level. The Deinonychus is also fiercely territorial near nests with eggs, even if the eggs aren't its own. This makes breeding successive generations a hazardous process. \n\nUnless raised from eggs, they cannot be tamed; the hunter instinct of a wild Deinonychus is so strong that it reflexively pounces on a would-be master.\n\n[b]When will this creature make its first appearance on the ARK?
