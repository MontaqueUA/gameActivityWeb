It seems like forever ago that I boarded at Deals Station Central, but there&#8217;s still a fair old time before we all reach our final destination that is the culmination of November&#8217;s online deals frenzy, Cyber Monday. Thus, it falls to me, your ever faithful deals herald to continue striving away at the deals-based coal face to bring you the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals around.</p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying you should just spend a load of money for the sake of it. Indeed, you should only really partake of Black Friday / Cyber Monday deals madness if you really need to upgrade to something. I ended up buying a laptop today, not because it was cheap (although that was certainly a factor), but because the battery on my current workhorse is practically bursting out from beneath my touchpad.

So, if you <em>are</em> thinking about upgrading your PC, Black Friday and its accompanying deals jamboree Cyber Monday can be a great time to pick up some deals on the cheap, whether it&#8217;s a new graphics card, CPU, SSD, headset, or mouse and keyboard.

As of today all existing owners should have a Steam Coupon that allows owners of the original game to purchase the Definitive Edition for $5.  Please be sure to use it before it expires in 90 days!\r\nAlso as a result of this change we’ll be able to participate in other discounts and turn gifting back on as many of our fans have requested.\r\n\r\nFor more details on how Steam Coupons work go here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4210-YIPC-0275&l=english\r\n\r\nFor more details on how Steam Gifts work go here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6262-QXCN-0755&l=english\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1476147351,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":387290},{"gid":"255953775632144067","title":"Wot I Think: Ori And The Blind Forest Definitive Edition","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/255953775632144067","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (John Walker)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/16/may/ori12.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Everyone should be allowed to take two goes at a game.

If you own it already you do not need to buy it again as there is no new or different content here.\r\n\r\n\r\nOri and the Blind Forest (Additional Soundtrack) contains 1) new tracks from the new areas in Definitive Edition, 2) music that was not released on the Official Soundtrack, 3) music from the 3 trailers that Moon Studios created for the game, 4) a selection of music that was unused or cut from the original game, and 5) a selection of music from the original Ori prototype. This soundtrack has only been available on Bandcamp and Youtube to this point.\r\n\r\nThe Official Soundtrack will continue to be priced at $9.99. The Additional Soundtrack will continue to be available here and elsewhere for free.\r\n\r\nBetween the Official and Additional soundtracks, completionists will have just about every cue that is heard in the game.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1461770699,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":387290},{"gid":"255953775610801246","title":"Now Available on Steam - Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition","url":"http://store.steampowered.com/news/21567/","is_external_url":false,"author":"Valve","contents":"<a href='http://store.steampowered.com/app/387290/'>Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition</a> is Now Available on Steam!
