We have enhanced a number of Legends who have unique properties on their Signatures, and have reduced the amount of risk on several overly committal attacks.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Axe[/h1]\r\n[i]We have increased the force of the aerial Down Air, as the recent change from Test Features left it slightly too weak at later health ranges.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Axe Down Air: Increased Force of the aerial version from 41 Fixed/25 Variable to 45 Fixed/30 Variable.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Blasters[/h1]\r\n[i]The Blasters Neutral Light combo has been removed in favor of less time between the 2nd and 3rd shot on-hit, as well as a more consistent setup location for less commitment in 2v2 games and more predictable solo strings. Some power has been shifted away from the Side Air's damage, in favor of an increased range of vertical follow-up attacks from the Down Light.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Blasters Neutral Light: Decreased Stun of the final hit from 22 to 20; Decreased time before the 3rd shot on hit from 18 to 15; Slightly lowered setup location of the 2nd shot.[/*]\r\n    [*]Blasters Side Air: Decreased Damage from 17 to 16.[/*]\r\n    [*]Blasters Down Light: Knockback angle from final shot is now more vertical.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Cannon[/h1]\r\n[i]A number of the Cannon's attacks, including the Down Light, Recovery, and Side Light, have received updates in hitboxing to more accurately match their intended threat ranges, resulting in slightly less coverage towards the rear and edges of these attacks. The Down Light has slightly increased Recover time on miss to better match its potential reward, while the Side Air has decreased Stun to open up dodge windows on some early health combos.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Cannon Down Light: Updated hitboxing to better match the animation, resulting in decreased Threat Coverage at the top and rear of the attack; Increased Recover time on miss from 0 Fixed/13 Variable to 1 Fixed/14 Variable.[/*]\r\n    [*]Cannon Recovery: Updated hitboxing to better match the animation, resulting in decreased Threat Coverage at the extreme edges and bottom of the attack.[/*]\r\n    [*]Cannon Side Air: Decreased Stun of the final hit from 14 to 12.[/*]\r\n    [*]Cannon Side Light: Reduced Threat Coverage towards the rear of this attack.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Gauntlets[/h1]\r\n[i]The Gauntlets Neutral Light has received slightly increased Damage to better match the low range on this attack.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Gauntlets Neutral Light: Increased Damage from 14 to 15.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Hammer[/h1]\r\n[i]We have increased the Stun of Hammer Down Light for more reliable follow-up attacks at all health ranges, as well as increasing the time before gravity resumes after Gravity Canceling this attack for more reliable aerial follow-up attacks.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Hammer Down Light: Increased Stun from 25 to 27; Increased Gravity Cancel time from 9 to 15.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Katars[/h1]\r\n[i]The Katar Down Light has proven to be too powerful of an anti-air, so we have reduced the Hit Window and Stun while increasing the Recover time on miss to open up greater windows for challenging this attack. Some of this power has been shifted into the Neutral Light for a slightly decreased Time to Hit. We have also increased the Variable Force of the Side Light and slightly decreased the Stun of the grounded Down Air to curtail some combos and strings that could far outpace the damage build of other weapons.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Katar Down Light: Decreased Hit Window from 7 to 5; Decreased Stun from a range of 22~16 to a range of 20~16; Increased Recover time on miss from 4 Fixed/18 Variable to 6 Fixed/18 Variable.[/*]\r\n    [*]Katar Side Light: Increased Force from 40 Fixed/0 Variable to 40 Fixed/8 Variable.[/*]\r\n    [*]Katar Neutral Light: Decreased Time to Hit from 7 to 6.[/*]\r\n    [*]Katar Down Air: Decreased Damage of the final hit of the grounded version from 6 to 4; Decreased Stun of the final hit of the grounded version from 12 to 11.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Scythe[/h1]\r\n[i]The Scythe Neutral Air and Neutral Light have both received slightly increased Recover time on miss to better match their potential reward, while the Neutral Air also slows the users momentum on hit to prevent it from carrying targets too far at low health ranges. We have also shifted some power from the Ground Pound's threat coverage in favor of increased Stun on the Side Air.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Scythe Neutral Air: Decreased the amount of momentum that can carry over into this attack on hit; Increased Recover time on miss from 3 Fixed/20 Variable to 4 Fixed/20 Variable.[/*]\r\n    [*]Scythe Neutral Light: Increased Recover time on miss from 3 Fixed/20 Variable to 5 Fixed/20 Variable.[/*]\r\n    [*]Scythe Ground Pound: Decreased Threat Coverage at the top of this attack.[/*]\r\n    [*]Scythe Side Air: Increased Stun from 20 to 22.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Spear[/h1]\r\n[i]We have increased the Stun and decreased the Recover time of the Spear's Neutral Air attack to provide more time to track an opponent's trajectory and initiate a followup attack.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Spear Neutral Air: Increased Stun of the final hit from 22 to 24; Decreased Recover time from 8 Fixed/17 Variable to 6 Fixed/17 Variable.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Sword[/h1]\r\n[i]The small gap between the multi-hit setup and the final hit of the Sword Recovery has been removed, granting users a more reasonable range in which to properly steer this attack for its forceful finish.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Sword Recovery: Increased Hit Window of the final hit from 1 to 3; Decreased time between the multi-hit setup and the final hit from 2 to 0.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Azoth[/h1]\r\n[i]The Recover time on Azoth's Neutral Axe has been decreased to better match its relatively lower threat coverage than most other anti-airs.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Azoth Neutral Axe: Decreased Recover time of the air landing from 14 to 12; Decreased Recover time of the ground landing from 10 to 8.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Isaiah[/h1]\r\n[i]Isaiah's Side Blasters has a lengthy total commitment, so we have significantly reduced its Recover time to help offset this risk.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Isaiah Side Blasters: Decreased Recover time from 19 to 14.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Petra[/h1]\r\n[i]To bring Petra's Neutral Gauntlets in line with other similar attacks, we have added some time both before and after the strike, while also slightly decreasing its late game knockout potential.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Petra Neutral Gauntlets: Increased Recover time from 8 to 9; Increased Minimum Charge time from 7 to 8; Decreased Force from a range of 95~75 Fixed/46~44 Variable to a range of 95~75 Fixed/44~40 Variable.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Rayman[/h1]\r\n[i]We have increased the amount of time users may charge and hover during Rayman's Down Gauntlets and Down Axe to make better use of their unique utility. The Down Gauntlets now have significantly less Recover time to better match its total duration, while the Down Axe has a quicker response with decreased Minimum Charge time. Rayman's Side Axe has also received an increase to its mobility in the form of faster travel speed during the charge, as well as increased damage for a more appropriate reward.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Rayman Down Gauntlets: Increased Maximum Charge time from 70 to 90; Decreased Recover time from 34 to 26.[/*]\r\n    [*]Rayman Down Axe: Increased Maximum Charge time from 67 to 82; Decreased Minimum Charge time from 13 to 10.[/*]\r\n    [*]Rayman Side Axe: Increased Damage of the final hit from 17 to 20; Increased travel speed.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Teros[/h1]\r\n[i]Given Teros' Side Axe lengthy total commitment, we have reduced its Recover time to help offset the risk involved.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Teros Side Axe: Decreased Recover time from 18 to 15.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Yumiko[/h1]\r\n[i]Both Yumiko's Down Bow and Down Hammer have received decreased Force, while the Down Bow is also granted increased Damage and Stun, for greater followup potential from these setup attacks. We have also reduced the Recover time of her Neutral and Side Bow Signature attacks to help offset their low priority.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Yumiko Down Bow: Increased Stun from 23 to 28; Decreased Force from 30 Fixed/15 Variable to 30 Fixed/7 Variable; Increased Damage of the final hit from 7 to 11.[/*]\r\n    [*]Yumiko Down Hammer: Changed Force from 40 Fixed/20 Variable to 48 Fixed/5 Variable.[/*]\r\n    [*]Yumiko Neutral Bow: Decreased Recover time of the air and ground landings from 8 to 6.[/*]\r\n    [*]Yumiko Side Bow: Decreased Recover time of the air and ground landings from 7 to 6.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Game Improvements[/h1]\r\nUser Interface\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Meet the Legends page now has working arrow buttons.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\nUser Experience\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Meet the Legends sorting mode can now be changed by clicking on the sorting text.[/*]\r\n    [*]You can now click and drag to change the current game mode or lobby mode in the game settings screen.[/*]\r\n    [*]Game settings on PC can now be changed by clicking and dragging them left or right.[/*]\r\n    [*]Tabs in the store can now be looped through when navigating with keyboard or controller.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\nArt\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Improved PC client rendering performance.[/*]\r\n    [*]Performance improvements on Hattori's Down Spear signature special effects.[/*]\r\n    [*]Minor updates to Katar Side Light and Down Air animations.[/*]\r\n    [*]Updated Bodvar's Neutral Hammer animation.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]\r\nUser Interface\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Fixed a bug where players' earnings in the esports menu were sometimes displaying as $0.01 below their actual earnings.[/*]\r\n    [*]Fixed a bug where spectators did not see the matchup numbers in ranked games.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\nGameplay\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Bow Down Air: Fixed a case where the aerial version could hit too close to the user.[/*]\r\n    [*]Rayman Side Gauntlets: Fixed a timing issue that prevented Rayman from charging to the enhanced version during a Gravity Cancel.[/*]\r\n    [*]Rayman Neutral Gauntlets: Fixed a timing issue that prevented Rayman from charging to the enhanced version during a Gravity Cancel.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Legend Rotation[/h1]\r\n[i]The new free-to-play Legend rotation for this week includes: Azoth, Ada, Isaiah, Gnash, Petra, Asuri, Sentinel, and Artemis.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Azoth – Devoted acolytes bring this brilliant and ruthless lich lord to life as he comes into Valhalla to do battle with Bow and Axe.[/*]\r\n    [*]Ada – Armed with Blasters and Spear, this nano-tech, elite combat hacker aims to win in the Grand Tournament.[/*]\r\n    [*]Isaiah – Major Isaiah Marshall, OEL's special forces commander is at your service.

The timer test feature has also graduated to live! We've added a toggle in the game settings menu for players who would like to know how much time is left.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Graduated Test Feature\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Stock Timer Test Feature, where the Match Timer will only show when there is less than a minute remaining in the game. You can toggle this option on or off.[/*]\r\n    [*]The modified Axe Down Air and Ground Pound have graduated from Test Features. These attacks are now part of the main Axe kit and replace the previous Down Air and Ground Pound. You can find information on the differences between these new Axe powers and the previous ones in the Balance section below.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Balance[/h1]\r\n[i]We have made a round of balance adjustments for some underperforming Signatures that have generally fallen behind the pace of the game. These changes are primarily focused on either reducing a Signature's Recover time so it gains a wider array of situations in which it may be safely used, or extending the travel distance of its attack to increase its effective threat range. There are also several changes to base weapon kits, including the new Axe Down Air and Ground Pound which have graduated from Test Features.[/i]\r\n \r\n[h1]Axe[/h1]\r\n[i]The modified Axe Down Air and Ground Pound have been graduated from Test Features as significant quality-of-life improvements, while also providing new use cases. The new landing swipe when a Down Air is performed near the ground has a larger Hit Window and far less Recover time when compared to the standard Down Air and can more easily lead into follow-up attacks. The Ground Pound is now a single spin instead of the previous double spin, resulting in far less total commitment. Momentum from movement such as a dash can be carried over into the Ground Pound, allowing for a great deal of movement during the charge and attack. The user's fall speed is also softened at the end of the spin for safer use off-stage.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Axe Down Air: Now has a new landing version when performed close to the ground.\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Changes the previous Axe Down Air to new one are as follows: Damage changed from a range of 18~10 to 18; Stun changed from a range of 18~22 to 22; Damage changed from a range of 58 Fixed/34 Variable to 41 Fixed/25 Variable; Hitboxing updated to better match animation; New landing version has a Hit Window of 8, compared to the aerial Hit Window of 4; New landing version has a Recover time of 0 Fixed/5 Variable on hit and 0 Fixed/6 Variable on miss, compared to the aerial Recover time of 1 Fixed/16 Variable on hit and 0 Fixed/28 Variable on miss.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[/*]\r\n    [*]Axe Ground Pound: Now a single spin that carries momentum.\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Changes from the previous Axe Ground Pound to the new one are as follows: Hit Window during charge changed from a Time to Hit of 36 to 17; Time to Hit when tapped changed from 20 to 17; Hit Window during the spin changed from 25 to 15; total Recover time changed from 10 Fixed/9 Variable to 8 Fixed/12 Variable; Damage changed from a range of 20~15 to a range of 20~18; Force changed from a range of 50~45 Fixed/45~40 Variable to a range of 50~40 Fixed/45~40 Variable; Fall speed softened during the second half of the spin; A portion of momentum from movement such as a dash carries over into the charge and spin.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Blasters[/h1]\r\n[i]We have increased the Stun on the final hit of Blasters Neutral Light to allow for closer follow-up attacks, as targets could too easily disengage after being struck by this low-force setup attack.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Blasters Neutral Light: Increased stun of final hit from 20 to 22.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Spear[/h1]\r\n[i]The Spear Ground Pound has received both a reduction in Recover time and increased Stun, as it could previously leave the user too vulnerable after striking opponents at lower health ranges.[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Spear Ground Pound: Decrease Recover time of the air release from 2 Fixed/26 Variable to 0 Fixed/26 Variable, and the ground version from 2 Fixed/28 Variable to 0 Fixed/28 Variable; Increased Stun from 19 to 22; Decreased Force from 53 Fixed/44 Variable to 53 Fixed/42 Variable.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Artemis[/h1]\r\n[i]The travel distance before Artemis' Side Lance blast, along with the travel distance of the recoil, have been increased to give this attack greater range that better fits with other similar attacks.

You’re going to have a soft Elo reset and will also receive Glory, the currency you receive for playing Ranked. You can use it in the Ranked section of Malhalla to get special Colors and Weapon Skins to show your dedication to your favorite Legend. We hope you enjoy your rewards and enjoy the New Season! [/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Soft Elo Reset Formula[/h1]\r\n[i] Soft Elo Reset is based on your current Elo at the end of the season. [/i]\r\n\r\n 1v1 and 2v2 Personal Rating \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Under 1400: New Elo = Old Elo [/*]\r\n \t[*] Over 1400: New Elo = 1400 + (Old Elo – 1400) / (3 – (3000 – Old Elo) / 800) [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]2v2 Team and Legend Rating[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] 2v2 Team & Legend Ratings  have been brought closer to 750. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Under 2000: Elo = (Elo + 375) / 1.5 [/*]\r\n \t[*] Over 2000, we aggressively brought you back down as a way of resetting the top tiers. Diamond level players will be reset to high gold or low platinum. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Glory Earnings Calculation[/h1]\r\n[i] Glory earned is based on a combination of your Highest Peak Rating (highest 1v1, 2v2, team, or Legend rating/Elo) and total Wins. This was designed in order to reward both skill and dedication for those who pursue Glory. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] You gain 20 Glory per win up to 150 wins, which gets you 3000 Glory. After 150 wins, each subsequent win gives you slightly less. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] Note: There is a minimum requirement of 10 games played to be eligible for Glory based on your rating. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] For help estimating your Glory Gained or New Elo after the reset go to:  [/i][url=http://www.brawlhalla.com/glory-calculator/][i] http://www.brawlhalla.com/glory-calculator/ [/i][/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Ranked Borders from Season 12[/h1]\r\n[i] If you placed in Gold or better in your best rating, you are given a ranked border that people will see in the match preview screen. There are Ranked borders for Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers. These will last for one season and will be updated again after the new season comes to a close. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] Your border from any previous season does not carry over or have any impact on your current border reward. [/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Ranked Avatars from Season 12[/h1]\r\n[i] Ranked Avatars include prestigious versions for those who’ve placed in high ranks during previous seasons. For example, if you placed in Platinum last season and Gold this season, you’ll receive the upgraded versions of the Competitor’s Badge and Gold Emblem. You will still have your original Platinum Emblem avatar from previous seasons. [/i]\r\n\r\nYou must play a minimum of 10 games to receive ranked avatars / borders at ANY rank. \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Competitor’s Badge: Awarded to anyone who plays 10 Ranked Games or more. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Gold Emblem: Awarded to players who finish at Gold or above. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Platinum Emblem: Awarded to players who finish at Platinum or above. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Diamond Emblem: Awarded to players who finish at Diamond. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Upgraded versions of Ranked Avatars are awarded to those who have earned the same Avatar in any previous seasons. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]5th & 6th Tier Ranked Avatar Upgrade Information[/h1]\r\n[i] For players who have reached the 5th Tier of an avatar by reaching a certain rank or higher for five total seasons: the 5th Tier of that avatar will stay in your inventory permanently! Congratulations on your achievements! [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] The 6th Tier Avatar, for those who have reached a certain rank or higher for six total seasons, will take on a brand new look! These avatars will grow more and more prestigious with each subsequent seasonal repeat up to Tier 10, at which point the Tier 10 avatar will remain in your inventory permanently. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] In short, every 5 Tiers of avatars, you’ll keep the most awesome, most decked out version permanently, and then start work on a new version for subsequent tiers for 6-10, 11-15, and so on. [/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Color Scheme – Goldforged![/h1]\r\n[i] Beyond glory there is immortality!  Goldforged color scheme is only purchasable with Glory and requires the Skyforged color scheme of that same Legend to have already been purchased. [/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Brawl of the Week - Ghost Brawl![/h1]\r\n[i] Ghost Brawl is back!  Quickly go invisible when you don’t use any powers in this tense game mode. Stay invisible too long, or use any power (including dodge) and you’re visible once more!  (Pro Tip: Dust clouds from jumps and dashes are still visible even when an opponent is not!)

[/*]\r\n \t[*] Check out the new Sales items! [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Balance[/h1]\r\n[i] This set of balance updates is focused on enhancing the reliability of setup attacks for underperforming weapons, while also reining in the combo or knockout potential on overperforming string-based weapons. [/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Katar[/h1]\r\n[i] Both the Katar Side and Neutral Light attacks have received improvements to their reliability, serving as consistent setup tools. The reduced force allows for continued follow-up attacks even at later health ranges, while also leaving the target closer on hit. The Side Light will now reliably combo into other grounded attacks, while the Neutral Light has received a minor stun reduction to keep its place as a string starter. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Katar Side Light: Changed Force from 10 Variable/35 Fixed to 0 Variable/40 Fixed; Increased Stun from 22 to 23. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Katar Neutral Light: Changed Force from 4 Variable/50 Fixed to 0 Variable/45 Fixed; Decreased Stun of final hit from 15 to 14. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Sword[/h1]\r\n[i] The Sword Down Light now launches slightly higher on its first swing for more reliable setup locations, while also slightly increasing its stun to allow for more varied follow-up attacks. The Side Air has also received increased force and a slightly more dangerous knockback angle, bringing it in line with similar options on other weapons. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Sword Down Light: Increased Stun from 19 to 21; Increased Force on initial hit from 0 Variable/40 Fixed to 0 Variable/55 Fixed. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Sword Side Air: Increased Force from 33 Variable/60 Fixed to 36 Variable/60 Fixed; Angle of knockback has been slightly lowered. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Hammer[/h1]\r\n[i] As the main option against stacked opponents, it is important for the Hammer Neutral Light to strike near the user. We have increased the coverage near the user for this attack to better serve its purpose. Similarly, we have altered the knockback scaling of the Hammer Down Air to better fit the Hammer's hard-hitting late game power. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Hammer Neutral Light: Increased stacked coverage near the user. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Hammer Down Air: Changed Force from 45 Variable/50 Fixed to 50 Variable/45 Fixed. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Lance[/h1]\r\n[i] The Lance kit contains a great deal of movement, but also a great deal of risk in its attacks. We have reduced the overall duration of the Neutral Light to give this weapon a slightly safer tool to poke with in the neutral game. This will allow Lance users to more effectively vary the pacing of their attacks and better compete with faster weapons. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Lance Neutral Light: Decreased Hit Window of the first swing from 6 to 5; Decreased time between the first and second swing from 13 to 10. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Gauntlets[/h1]\r\n[i] We have adjusted the stun on a couple of Gauntlet attacks to rein in multi-hit true combos that were allowing this weapon to build damage at a much faster rate than other similar options. These have been opened up into strings, allowing for more appropriate counterplay and escape options. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Gauntlets Neutral Air: Decreased horizontal coverage of the attack; Decreased Stun from 19 to 15; Decreased Force from 22 Variable/47 Fixed to 20 Variable/47 Fixed; Decreased Damage from 13 to 12. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Gauntlets Recovery: Decreased Stun from 25 to 22; Decreased Force from a range of 50~35 Variable/45 Fixed to a range of 48~35 Variable/45 Fixed. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Scythe[/h1]\r\n[i] The Scythe has received a number of changes to allow for more appropriate risk versus reward when edgeguarding against this weapon. It is now easier to properly challenge this attack from the rear and to escape strings involving this attack by dodging behind it. We have also slightly reduced the knockback scaling on the Scythe's reversal attacks, granting more chances to recover when tossed below or away from the stage. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Scythe Recovery: Decreased threat coverage near the rear of the user; Decreased Force from 40 Variable/53 Fixed to 37 Variable/50 Fixed; Angle of knockback is now more horizontal. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Scythe Down Air: Decreased Force of the backwards version from 27 Variable/52 Fixed to 23 Variable/52 Fixed. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Scythe Neutral Air: Decreased Force of the backwards version from 35 Variable/34 Fixed to 30 Variable/34 Fixed. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Unarmed[/h1]\r\n[i] We have increased the focus on armed combat by reducing the damage and force of some key attacks in the Unarmed base kit. This ensures armed players an edge in how quickly damage can be built, as well as knockout potential in edgeguard situations. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Unarmed Neutral Air: Decreased Damage from 14 to 11. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Unarmed Recovery: Changed Force from 46 Variable/53 Fixed to 40 Variable/55 Fixed. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Bow[/h1]\r\n[i] The Bow Recovery could catch players too long after its initial attack, improperly skewing the risk versus reward of attempting to edgeguard against this weapon. We have reduced the duration and front coverage during the end of this attack for more intuitive counterplay. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Bow Recovery: Decreased Hit Window from 8 to 7; Decreased front coverage on the later portion of the attack. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Game Improvements[/h1]\r\n User Experience \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Made it possible to start a tournament with a mouse. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n Animation \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Improved seaming of knee joints on the Slow Clap animation. [/*]\r\n \t[*] In the Power Up Taunt, layered the front arm to not appear behind the torso. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Tweaked the Deal With It Taunt animation to work better with certain skins. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Tweaked the back arm after the second swing on Jhala's Neutral Axe signature. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n Localization \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Thanks to Juangana for the continued help with the Spanish translation! [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]\r\n User Interface \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Fixed a visual bug in the public game list filters screen causing the highlighted region of the \"Go Back\" button to be wider than the actual button art. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Fixed a bug where sometimes the Featured tab would show up blank. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n Gameplay \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Fait Neutral Orb: Fixed a case where the threat could cover past the rear of the swing. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n Replay \r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Fixed a bug where the replay generated from spectating a Horde match would be wrong. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Legend Rotation[/h1]\r\n[i] The new Legend rotation for this week includes: Jhala, Kor, Lord Vraxx, Kaya, Ragnir, Jiro, Fait, and Sidra. [/i]\r\n[list]\r\n \t[*] Jhala –   Given the title \"Exalted Lion\" by Apollo himself, Jhala \"The Unbroken\" takes the glamor of Valhalla in stride while having fun slaying her foes with Axe and Sword. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Kor -   Blackguard Keep's left platform mover takes his place in the arena wielding both Gauntlets and Grappling Hammer. [/*]\r\n \t[*] Lord Vraxx – This feared warlord dominates his opponents with Rocket Lance and Blasters!
