What this means is that the world is made of different materials that can be destroyed and react to each other. Wood burns, and water coming into contact with fire creates steam that in turn condenses back into water, and so on.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567092774,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":350070}],"count":43}}
