With this major milestone in our game’s history, we’re releasing Update 1.0. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftaYaX5A84c\r\nUpdate 1.0 focuses on our New Player Experience. This update fixes a ton of bugs, adds a lot of polish, introduces more quality-of-life changes, improves our early-game experience, and gets new players through Campaign and deep into Chaos. After today, we’re spinning up on features and changes you’ve been asking for (Endless Mode says hi).\r\n \r\nWe’ve been in Early Access for more than two years. With more than 60+ updates, Dungeon Defenders II has grown up before our very eyes. It’s been exciting and, quite frankly, a little unnerving to develop a game with you watching every step of the way. Our growth and improvement is because of your support, your feedback and the dedicated members of our team who went above and beyond to drive our game forward. We’re proud of where Dungeon Defenders II is today, but launch is just the beginning. With your support, Dungeon Defenders II is only going to get bigger and better!\r\n \r\nHere are the notes for Update 1.0:\r\n \r\n[h1]Xbox One Version Available Now![/h1]\r\nBrewed in secrecy, the Xbox One version is finally here! We’re also pleased to announce that the Xbox One version, at launch, is completely caught up to our PC & PS4 versions! \r\n\r\n[img]https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGceZXxS409p4kCI/giphy.gif[/img]\r\n \r\n[h1]Features[/h1]\r\n[b]The Initiate[/b]\r\nCome on and SLAM! \r\n \r\nThe Initiate is our first gender-swap hero. This powerful Chi-wielding warrior is the gender swap of our bald friend, the Monk. She uses the same defenses as the Monk, but she comes with a suite of new abilities:\r\n [list][*][b][i]Chi Stomp:[/i][/b]  A powerful slam that can be activated in mid-air!\r\n[*][b][i]Crippling Chi Wave:[/i][/b]  The Initiate builds up a glowing ball of Chi and launches it at her enemies, which damages and debuffs any enemies hit!\r\n[*][b][i]Talisman of Empowerment:[/i][/b]  The Initiate places a talisman on the ground that temporarily boosts the power of nearby defenses![/list]\r\n \r\nThe Initiate is available at a lower Gem and Defender Medal price than other heroes. And don’t worry:  The Barbarian will have his time to shine soon.\r\n \r\n[b]Updated Tutorials[/b]\r\nPlay our all new Tutorial map and check out our new Tutorial videos with the new How To Play Menu! The new videos and map cover a variety of helpful hints, tips, and tricks that will aid in your defense of Etheria!\r\n \r\n[b]Updated Story and Campaign[/b]\r\nEtheria has never felt so alive! Play through the updated story in our revamped Campaign experience and stave off the Old Ones advance. Prepare for new threats and twists that will appear. Make sure to keep an eye out during Build Phase!\r\n \r\n[b]New Summary Screen & Score System[/b]\r\nAt the end of each map, whether you win or lose, there’s a new summary screen that will score you based on your performance. Our new scoring system includes many different modifiers and bonuses to help you tweak your builds and get higher and higher on your personal mental leaderboard. Shortly after the release of score, we’ll add some form of score tracking for players to see!\r\n \r\n[b]Updated HUD & Health Bars[/b]\r\nWe’ve updated a number of our Heads-Up Display elements to make the UI cleaner while providing more information. The biggest change is the addition of hero deck hotkeys above the Health Bar. Now you can easily see which hero is in which hero deck slot hotkey, which is especially handy if you’re the kind of player who constantly rotates heroes in and out of your Hero Deck!\r\n \r\n[b]New Tower Skins[/b]\r\nCheck out the all new Bit Crush Dryad, Woodland Apprentice, and Hypno Abyss Lord Tower Skins! (Time for an Abyss Lord/Monk defensive DANCE PARTY! Unce unce unce #hype)\r\n \r\n[b]New Shard Icons[/b]\r\nWe’ve added new iconography for some of the most popular Shards in the game. We’ll continue to improve on our Shard icons after launch! \r\n[list][*]Channel - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Inspiration - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Hero Critical Strike - Minor Border Change\r\n[*]Life Leech - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Speed Boost - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Superconductor - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Construction - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Explosive Guard - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Defensive Critical Damage - Minor Border Change\r\n[*]Destruction - Minor Border Change\r\n[*]Fortification - Minor Border Change\r\n[*]Deadly Strikes - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Panic Fire - Icon Type Change\r\n[*]Press Your Luck - Icon Type Change[/list]\r\n \r\n[b]Incursions & Legendary Weapons[/b]\r\nAs part of our New Player Experience, we’ve introduced Incursions into Chaos! The goal of our Incursions is to provide variety and progression milestones as players progress through Chaos.\r\n \r\nEach Chaos tier will now have its own unique Incursions. After completing an Incursion, you’ll unlock unique Legendary weapons at the Wayfarer! The Wayfarer will forge these unique weapons based on your highest powered hero. The Wayfarer will sell these weapons for Defender Medals, so be sure to sell those Souls4Gold when the update comes out!\r\n \r\nAs for long-term gameplay variety in our endgame, we have a number of interesting changes and features we’re going to add post-launch. Stay tuned!\r\n \r\n[b]New Weapons[/b]\r\nIn addition to the Wayfarer weapons, we’ve added many new weapon models to the game across many of our different heroes. Go forth and get that sweet new loot!\r\n \r\n[b]PS4 Optimization[/b]\r\nThis update improves PS4 framerate, especially when a lot of enemies are on-screen at once. This is just the first of our optimization updates for the PS4 -- shortly after launch, we have a litany of other changes that should improve framerate even more!\r\n \r\n[h1]Quality of Life[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Added a new Minimum Ascension Level host option.\r\n[*]Added the ability to rename your heroes for free in the Inventory.\r\n[*]Added controller sensitivity option on PC.\r\n[*]Revamped range indicator decals for visibility.\r\n[*]Now you can play and access everything on PC with a controller, including the Options Menu!\r\n[*]Added the names of defenses under relic slots.\r\n[*]Added Server Region display to the Main Menu.\r\n[*]Improved the Flamethrower Tower’s visual effects.\r\n[*]Added a minimap and NPC blips to the Heroes Marketplace.\r\n[*]Improved player name display with proper capitalization!\r\n[*]Added a “Hold <blank> to rotate tower” for PC controller users.\r\n[*]Improved and unified the look of many different UIs.\r\n[*]Updated the first quest in the game to have smarter text and a better UI.\r\n[*]Victory chests show up on all minimaps.\r\n[*]The War Table in the Private Tavern should now default to Private Games.

Squire is now “Squire.”  Monk is now “Monk.”  Barbarian is now “Pete.”\r\n[*]Fixed a challenge display issue where it would render completed challenges twice in the UI.\r\n[*]Flame Aura properly calculates crit damage and chance into its inspected DPS number.\r\n[*]Fixed a matchmaking issue where if Player 2 declines, then Player 1 gets an “Unknown Error.”\r\n[*]Fiery Brimstone Shard now only works for the Abyss Lord as originally designed and fixed the critical damage scaling on the procs from 100% to 12% where it should be.\r\n[*]Unequipping items will go through the auto-collect flow and go to the bags that they should be.\r\n[*]Fixed an issue where swapping to EV2 Mark III was causing a rogue torso to display.\r\n[*]Fixed Drakken’s eyes and mouths to be glowing properly.\r\n[*]Added a notification that a party request has been sent to another player.\r\n[*]The “Could not authenticate with Steam… try again?” pop up was missing some buttons.

Beam only shown on items not filtered from the minimap by quality\r\n[*]Added toggle key (b) for particle beams\r\n[*]Updated minimap colors for ult+ and ult++ (orange and red respectively)\r\n[*]Electric aura’s can damage the tavern dummy\r\n[*]The highest damage dealt to a target by chained proximity mines will be dealt instead of the first to deal the damage\r\n[*]Maximum starting wave is now set per map (24 on 25 wave maps, 28 on 30 wave maps, 32 on 35 wave maps, 36 on 40 wave maps)\r\n[*]Camera rotation is locked when in top down placement mode (building / repairing / upgrading)\r\n[*]New Setting - Can move while building (disables movement while in top down placement)\r\n[*]New Setting -Enable tower dynamic lighting (significant performance benefits when disabled.) Affects traps and projectile towers (most notably inferno traps and fireball towers) Requires restarting DD after enabling to take effect. Disabling requires a new tower of that type to be built.\r\n[*]Cursor placed relative to the hero in the placement casting state\r\n[*]Removed slight frame rate dependency from many damaging towers. All projectile towers, Lightning Tower, Slice’n Dice, and Proton Beam. Every point in tower rate counts. There are no breakpoints.\r\n[*]New item comparison calculation for armour and accessories\r\n[*]Items can be renamed when at their maximum upgrade level at the cost of one upgrade\r\n[*]Item naming character limit has been increased to 36\r\n[*]Added a report issue button to the pause menu\r\n[*]Palantir, Greater Turkey Hunt, CD, Temple of Love, Winter Wonderland, and Silent Night accessory multipliers now match those awarded by lab assault\r\n[*]Moonbase now has a survival mode\r\n[*]Added confirmation message when hitting 42 on Moonbase DDR machine\r\n[*]Initiate Enemy Drain ability, Spider Minion web, and Wheel of Fortuna buff/debuff enemies resistance factor applied to the training dummy\r\n[*]Jester’s Move Tower and Wheel abilities can be used in the tavern\r\n[*]Trap/Aura selection priority is identical for repairing. Selection will be based only on current health percentage.\r\n[*]Trap/Aura upgrade priority favours traps when upgrades are equal, otherwise whichever tower has the least upgrades.\r\n[*]Instant upgrade will favour towers that can be upgraded over repairing towers that are at their maximum upgrade level.\r\n[*]Traps and auras can overlap spawns and show a warning when doing so\r\n[*]BucBay - Repositioned the hero spawn points to face the main crystal and open area instead of the dead end.\r\n[*]Golding an enemy (by Djinn / Wheel) increases its power by a percentage so the power boost scales into higher level games\r\n[*]Djinn ability casting durations depend on difficulty (enemy gold beam and tower desummon). That is to say, buffing/desummoning takes more time on a lower difficulty\r\n[*]Summoner minions can move sensibly over short distances with no pathfinding mesh present (ie. when placed on walls, they won’t always jump off before moving along)\r\n[*]On Nightmare difficulty, the 50% of loot that was not receiving wave/difficulty multipliers has been replaced with fully scaled items\r\n[*]Party Popper tower animation scaling reduced so it doesn’t spaz out with only a few points in tower rate\r\n[*]EV beam collision is now much more consistent between pre/post placement\r\n[*]Armour vs. weapon comparison skewed more in favour of armour to bias the drop removal priority\r\n[*]Traps on uneven terrain can now trigger on any walking enemy inside its radius\r\n[*]Slow ogre spawns on some maps on NM difficulty are much improved in many cases\r\n[*]Armour type drops rates boosted by 25% for random equipment drops.\r\n[*]Character health over 1 million is displayed using the high value format to 4 significant figures (eg. 1.234 M) to prevent the health value running off screen\r\n[*]Excess equipment removal function has been rewritten. Fixed an unconfirmed issue which removed many more items than intended under some circumstances, and it is much faster.\r\n[*]Excess mana removal function rewritten. Introduced a biasing system to keep tokens with a larger value around for longer. Large tokens will still be deleted eventually. This is not a bug, but a design decision that was made to prevent players waiting until the end of the round to collect mana and not being significantly penalised for doing so.\r\n[*]Multiple upgrades can be applied to an item in a single click when using “pro mode”. No key down - 1 upgrade per click. Shift down - Applies up to 9 upgrades per click. Ctrl down - Applies up to 50 upgrades per click\r\n[*]Predicted stat value will account for the number of upgrades to be applied\r\n[*]Invasion shows the current phase number in the UI\r\n[*]Inferno trap damage and attack rate updates for (de-)buffs in real time\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Balance Updates[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Slice’N Dice and Lightning Tower - Higher damage output. Damage per tick now increases with the attack rate stat so that damage output continues to scale into lategame (including buffs and debuffs). Scaling revised to account for this.\r\n[*]Bowling Ball Tower - Faster attacks. Animation time exponent increased from 0.8 to 1.0 (significant increase in high end attack rate). Bowling ball tower damage had fallen well behind at high levels due to it’s below average animation duration scaling. Increasing the scaling exponent to 1.0 brought the damage up to comparable levels and makes it easier to compare across towers for future changes.\r\n[*]Magic Missile Tower - More powerful attacks. Damage scaling exponent increased from 1.105 to 1.15. Single target towers need to do more damage than multi target towers. The MMT wasn’t, so it gets a small buff.\r\n[*]Darkness, Inferno, and Gas traps - Base charges increased to 3 from 1/2/2. \r\n[*]Ethereal Spike Trap - Base charges increased from 2 to 4. Attack radius now scales with trigger radius so it can always hit the enemy that triggered the trap. Damage now scales much, much faster\r\n[*]Proximity Mine Trap - Base charges increased from 2 to 4\r\n[*]Mana Bomb and Purity Bomb - Significant increase in damage scaling. Blocked in assault challenges due to combination of absurdly high damage and long range\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Possible fix to lock down hero info and equipment info UI istances to help prevent future chances of item stealing\r\n[*]Fixed Diamonds spawn\r\n[*]Fixed level 60 armor dropping on low difficulties\r\n[*]Fixed flying enemies not correctly triggering traps\r\n[*]Fixed Pure Strategy on Embermount and Buccaneer Bay\r\n[*]Proton beams and inferno traps with high attack rates now deal damage every tick.

Fully upgraded buffs are nearly identical, but unupgraded beams are significantly more powerful and the scaling with stats is much more noticeable\r\n[*]Slice’N Dice and Lightning Tower - Higher damage output.  Damage per tick now increases with the attack rate stat so that damage output continues to scale into lategame (including buffs and debuffs). Scaling revised to account for this.\r\n[*]Bowling Ball Tower - Faster attacks.  Animation time exponent increased from 0.8 to 1.0 (significant increase in high end attack rate).  Bowling ball tower damage had fallen well behind at high levels due to it’s below average animation duration scaling. Increasing the scaling exponent to 1.0 brought the damage up to comparable levels and makes it easier to compare across towers for future changes.\r\n[*]Deadly Striker Tower - Slightly slower, more powerful attacks.  Animation time exponent increased from 0.67 to 1.0.  Attack Rate exponent reduced from 0.77 to 0.6.  Damage scaling exponent increased from 1.1 to 1.36  Base damage decreased from 350 to 300.  An even worse case than the bowling ball tower for the attack rate being restricted by the firing animation. Overall attack rate scaling was reduced to compensate for the faster animation and keep the tower in it’s niche (slow, high damage). Damage scaling increased to bring it closer to other towers at high stats (because of a quirk in how damage is calculated, base damage remains the same even though it was decreased)\r\n[*]Magic Missile Tower - More powerful attacks.  Damage scaling exponent increased from 1.105 to 1.15.  Single target towers need to do more damage than multi target towers. The MMT wasn’t, so it gets a small buff.\r\nDarkness, Inferno, and Gas traps - Base charges increased to 3 from 1/2/2.  Trigger radius scaling reduced to match cloud radius scaling\r\n[*]Ethereal Spike Trap - Base charges increased from 2 to 4.  Attack radius now scales with trigger radius so it can always hit the enemy that triggered the trap.  Damage now scales much, much faster, starting off at ~3.5x a proximity mine trap, and ending up around 10x the same trap\r\n[*]Proximity Mine Trap - Base charges increased from 2 to 4\r\n[*]Mana Bomb and Purity Bomb - Significant increase in damage scaling.  Blocked in assault challenges due to combination of absurdly high damage and long range[/list]\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback!\r\n\r\n- Acen","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1463330822,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":65800},{"gid":"255953140179914234","title":"New DD1 Community Event: Dark Elf Hunting!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/255953140179914234","is_external_url":true,"author":"[TrendyEnt] iamisom","contents":"[img]http://puu.sh/ojF4Y/aa290676a9.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThe Community Development Team is hosting a brand-new community event this weekend!

We are now into February of the new year and we continue to press on with the task of providing you new content and changes to enjoy as you defend Etheria. We have a couple of things we would like to share with you today to get you ready for what is coming.\r\n\r\n[h1]When is the next update?[/h1]\r\nFirst up is the question that many are asking and direct at us quite frequently. Our usual response is \"soon\" since it is hard to get exact dates in place for various reasons. However we would like to let you know that we are targeting mid February to release the public beta.\r\n\r\n[h1]What is in CDT Update 2?[/h1]\r\nAs many may know by now, we are bringing Embermount Volcano over from DDE. Along with the new map comes a new tavern theme, new enemy, new weapons, accessories and pets. Here comes one of the pets trotting in now.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/QtuLVpf.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of QoL fixes and some rebalancing of a few towers that have needed it.  \r\n\r\n[h1]How can I help?[/h1]\r\nHelp us test! This update is packed full of content and changes that need to be checked by you, the community. We would love to think that the release will be perfect, but we know bugs happen. So please give it a good run through when it is released and report any issues back to us. \r\n\r\n[h1]Dev Help Needed![/h1]\r\nWe are in need of a visual effects artist. While the team is great at many things, this is one area where we could use some help. If there is someone in the community who is willing to share their talents in creating visual effects with Unreal Cascade, we would be grateful to have you on the team. The community would be grateful too.\r\n\r\n[h1]New Community Event:  Depths and Bubbles Event[/h1]\r\nThere is a new event planned for Feb 12th - 14th. Please check out the details in the [url=https://dungeondefenders.com/1/topic/130896/depths-and-bubbles-event]Depths and Bubbles thread.[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]More to Come[/h1]\r\nThere is definitely much more come.  Be on the lookout for futher news and opportunites for you to vote and share your opinions about what you think will make Etheria even better.  We are already planning Update 3 for you so please keep the ideas flowing and submitting them to us. \r\n\r\nI will leave you now with a couple of screenshots from the upcoming Update 2 for you to enjoy and see what is coming your way.\r\n\r\n[img]http://puu.sh/mSOKg/fdc8939b20.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://puu.sh/mT69L/e0b6613612.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nHappy Defending!!!\r\n\r\n- Community Development Team\r\n\r\n[i]The Community Development Team is a group of volunteer community members dedicated to adding new content, adjusting balance and fixing bugs in the Ranked version of the game.

Any towers or heroes spawning while Nightmare is selected will use Nightmare levels of all other stats but will not update when switching between difficulties.\r\n[*]Mana token and player shop max price increased to 2B\r\n[*]EV builders can now move while placing the child node of a beam.

It has high health and a slow attack rate, but makes up for this with high damage and knock-back capability, with a 20% chance to knock back enemies normally immune to knockback effects, such as Ogres.\r\n[*]Party Popper (Level 3, 4 DU, 50 mana):  A standard, mid-range projectile defense which shoots a wide range of projectiles with different attributes at random: Magic Missile (generic), Archer Minion arrow (generic), Fireball (fire, small splash radius), Djinn magic bolts (Fire, Lightning, Poison and Purity- all piercing), Deadly Striker bolts (generic, passes through walls), and Ogre poison balls (poison, huge splash radius). Inspecting this tower will show the element and damage for the next shot to be fired.\r\n[*](Note: Only new Jester heroes will have the new defenses set to their hotbars autmatically. We have not altered the hotkeys for existing Jesters, so you will need to manually add them by opening the radial menu with the middle mouse button, go to Summon Defenses, and then hold the desired number key down for one second with the cursor over the Defense you wish to assign to the bar)[/list][/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Bug Fixes[/b]\r\n[list][*]Reload speed, charge speed, knockback, blocking, guardian and propeller cat boosting stat generation clamped within their allowable range (no more picking up a sword with 1000% Blocking Bonus only to find it turned into 30% in your item box)\r\n[*]Tavern Dummy is only hit once per tick by the Slice’N Dice and Lightning Towers to match all other targets\r\n[*]“Pro-Mode” and “Invest All” function as expected when the cost to upgrade exceeds 1B mana\r\n[*]Greater Turkey Hunt correctly spawns 8 turkey bosses\r\n[*]“Invest All” will bring the bank mana to zero if the upgrade cost is greater than the banked mana\r\n[*]“UnLock/Lock All” item box functions no longer cause long freezes when used\r\n[*]Akatiti water no longer removes the slowing effect of a spider web\r\n[*]Projectiles reflected by a reflect beam no longer trigger the genie pet granting mana if they hit an enemy\r\n[*]Enemies with suppressed elemental effects are always affected by gas traps\r\n[*]Guns with negative ammunition counts (displayed as 1 ammo)  can now be upgraded\r\n[*]Fix banking mana at the forge eating the invested mana\r\n[*]“Report Issue” button in options menu now points to a public form (and results are sent directly to the CDT)\r\n[*]Online mode defaults to steam\r\n[*]Fix for certain weapons forcibly spawning with max stats[/list]","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1449759197,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":65800},{"gid":"378661012849334803","title":"CDT Update 1 Beta Updated","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/378661012849334803","is_external_url":true,"author":"[TrendyEnt] iamisom","contents":"A message from the Community Development Team:\r\n\r\nCDT Update 1 testing continues! We've included some additional fixes, as well as made some changes based on your feedback (The genie has decided to grant your wishes and returned to his old self)! If you haven't checked it out previously, it's not too late! Simply right-click on Dungeon Defenders in Steam, click Properties, click the Betas tab, and select \"community beta branch\" from the list!\r\n\r\nHere's the lowdown:\r\n\r\n[h1]Jester[/h1]\r\n\r\nJack-in-the-Box\r\n[list][*]You asked for it, you got it: Now has 20% chance to \"crit\", dealing slightly more damage and applying knockback to all enemies (including Ogres!), as well as affecting heavier enemies such as Orcs more strongly.\r\n[*]An errant muzzle flash left behind by the JITB's \"projectile\" has been told what to go do with itself.\r\n[*]Overall attack speed slowed through a combination of adjusting Tower Rate stat scaling and animation scaling. The animation should be visible for a much wider range of attack rate stats. We felt that this was important since there is no other visual indicator of the tower attacking.\r\n[*]Damage increased significantly to compensate for the slower attack rate. Now those punches really... pack a punch.\r\n[*]Range is no longer affected by buff beams or Monk Guardians. No more super sonic punches that extend several times the reach of the punching animation!\r\n[*]Base range slightly increased, range scaling slightly reduced; the Jack-in-the-Box should be able to bloody the noses of ogres attacking at their max range sooner. After all, they're Ogres, not Trolls.[/list]\r\n\r\nParty Popper\r\n[list][*]The Party Popper has given up dancing, and will no longer \"Do the Twist\" while attacking.\r\n[*]Projectile ratios adjusted favor splashing/piercing projectiles slightly more for extra party fun:\r\n[list][*]Magic Missile and Archer Arrow ratio decreased very slightly (Deadly Striker Bolt unchanged)\r\n[*]Fire, Poison, Thunder, and Purity Djinn shot ratio increased very slightly\r\n[*]Ogre Snot Ball and Fireball increased very slightly[/list]\r\n[*]The pierce limit for Djinn shots has been increased by 50% (4 to 6). Magnum Bullets![/list]\r\n*Overall effect should be more area-of-effect damage, to address player feedback.\r\n\r\n[h1]Maps[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Fixed an invisible wall on Buccaneer Bay. You'll have to practice your miming skills elsewhere, sorry!\r\n[*]Fixed an edge case in Pirate Invasion where finishing a phase with only a few seconds left would cause the game to glitch out.\r\n[*]Gave aerial enemies in Buccaneer Bay a strategy lesson. They should now spawn in a much less erratic pattern.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Bugs / Issues Fixed[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Say ARRRRrrrr: the Pirate Patch has been buffed up to Turkey Mask levels.\r\n[*]Shiver me Timbers: The Pirate Skeleton on a Treadmill is sporting a new icon and a colorization issue on the skeleton has been addressed.\r\n[*]The original Christmas map boss will now listen to you yelling at him to hurry up (or at least pressing the skip button) and thus his intro cutscene can now be skipped.\r\n[*]Shock beams now use standard healing logic, which is a really fancy way of saying pets and abilities can now repair them.\r\n[*]The Shock Beam was also told to stop using its cheat code, and no longer heals itself to full after every attack.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Bugs Added[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Genies will once again grant you three wishes, as we have reverted him to his previous state. This may be revisited in the future when/if the bug can be fixed without causing undue burden to our hardcore fans.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Known Issues[/h1]\r\n[list][*]Mac / Linux builds of Moonbase and later patches are still in progress. We hope that this will be able to be addressed at some point, but there is no guarantee.\r\n[*]The Pirate Patch reward is currently clamped to Insane.\r\n[*]The beta branch is defaulting to GameSpy (which no longer exists) as the Online Provider. To fix this, please go into the game's configure tool and change the Online Provider back to Steam in order to play online.

Early next week, we are incrementing save files for the beta branch, which means that you will enter this branch with all the stuff you currently have in the live game.

After these updates, it’s our goal to pass the torch onto you and give the community the tools to update Dungeon Defenders.\r\n\r\nThe first update is planned to be released onto a public beta branch in late May. It will include some of the bug fixes and quality of life changes requested by you, and finally put Moonbase where it rightfully belongs -- in Ranked. The second update will be a free content update, partially made by the community! To assist, we are actively seeking community members who are interested in contributing to this patch. If you’re interested, please contact [url=https://www.dungeondefenders.com/2/user/48136]Acen[/url], who has volunteered to help us get the team off the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter this, we will be assisting this team and you to release future updates. There are already many of you crafting unique creations for Dungeon Defenders every day, and we’re excited to give you a path to get these officially released into Ranked. \r\n\r\nThe Dungeon Defenders community is filled with passionate, talented, dedicated people. While many of you have already visited Dragonfall and rebuilt your defenses, you mean everything to us and we want to set up a future where you can always revisit the original in all its glory.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nThe Trendy Team","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1430938271,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":65800},{"gid":"518255472499569420","title":"Thank you for your support!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/518255472499569420","is_external_url":true,"author":"[TrendyEnt] Pmasher","contents":"Greetings Defenders,\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/YVJx7pE.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWe’ve just updated Dungeon Defenders II Early Access with two of your most requested features -- pets and a boss!
