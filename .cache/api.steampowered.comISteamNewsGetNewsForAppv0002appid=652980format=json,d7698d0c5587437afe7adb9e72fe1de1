It is me, Cake Eater or Ruslan. I’d like to make a short announcement. \r\n\r\nFirst of all thanks everyone for positive feedback on LSS. I was not expecting that much of attention to such a silly stupid awful game. Some of your comments and reviews are just amazing! It was very fun to read them. I got a chance to talk to a lot of players and made some new friends. And that’s very nice.\r\n\r\nI’ll talk more about LSS later but for now I Just want to say thank you.\r\n\r\n[h1]Now Let's get to the point.[/h1]\r\n\r\nI have been working on another game for a while now. It is called “Seven: Reboot”. Some of you have already heard of it. It is a remake of one of my old games. And it finally got a [url=store.steampowered.com/app/654200/Seven_Reboot/]page[/url] on Steam! I would like you to go to the [url=store.steampowered.com/app/654200/Seven_Reboot/]page[/url] and check it out. And if you will get interested in Seven make sure to add it to your wishlist, so that you will know when it comes out.\r\n\r\nSeven is a very unusual game. I don’t think I have ever seen anything like it. “Seven: Reboot” is a cryptic experimental puzzle game. It’s about numbers and their meaning. It is about information and ways to hide it in everything! I really like how it’s turning out so far and hope that when it comes out you will like it too.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested check out the [url=store.steampowered.com/app/654200/Seven_Reboot/]page[/url] and also… I have left you something interesting ;)\r\n\r\nThere is a [url=cakeeatergames.ru/Seven/]website[/url] and there is “something” there. if you will find that “something” and send me some screenshots you will get a chance to participate in a beta test of the game and of course get a game itself. (Limited Offer, only 10 people)\r\n\r\nThat’s it for now. Thanks for your time. Good luck\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1515652353,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":652980}],"count":1}}
