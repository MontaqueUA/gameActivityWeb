While there were many factors working against me - my age, my characteristic lack of dexterity, my (for the time) toaster-level PC, and my bargain-bin 200 DPI Dell laser mouse - I never let these disadvantages stop me from padding some lucky player's K/D ratio with my ill-fated MAC-10 rushes. When I would search through the list of servers for players of a similar skill level, I would come across a panoply of fan-made mods and maps intended to offer a respite from the endless dual grind of de_dust and cs_office, and I would occasionally take the plunge and sully my dad's hard-drive with these bizarre creations.</p><p>Of these offerings, the most consistently-populated servers were always devoted to the act of \"surfing,\" a fact that boggled my pre-teen mind. When I would connect, I would see long, sloped ramps to nowhere, curling and twisting through empty space towards an unknown destination. While my opponents seemed to slide across the slope with ease, I would hurtle into the abyss every single time. No matter how loudly I pleaded with my fellow surfers to explain the trick, they would hurl obscenities at me and tell me to use F10 to deploy parachute - a button which would, in fact, abort the game. (To be fair, it was pretty funny the first time.) Later in life, I eventually figured out that holding a movement key against the slope allowed you to stick to the path, and I embraced surfing and other such \"trickjumping\" as a fun palate-cleanser at the end of a long night of gaming.</p><p>Charlie \"Mariowned\" Joyce is the apparent inventor of the first surf map for Counter-Strike 1.6. Joyce confided this in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a4r4yz/whats_your_greatest_accomplishment_that_you_cant/\" target=\"_blank\">AskReddit thread</a> where people revealed their \"greatest accomplishment\" that they can't bring up in normal conversation, and he was immediately mobbed by fans of his work, and surfing in general. \"It was pretty overwhelming,\" he tells me. \"I thought I'd just get a couple of people saying, 'hey, I remember surfing, that's cool.' Or maybe, best-case scenario, reconnecting with an old buddy. But it was way, way more than that.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-15-meet-the-guy-who-accidentally-invented-surf-maps-in-counter-strike\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1550232000,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":10},{"gid":"2462791699364348565","title":"Update Released for Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, and the Source SDK 2013 Base","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/news/42271/","is_external_url":false,"author":"Valve","contents":"Updates for Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, and the Source SDK 2013 Base have been released.
