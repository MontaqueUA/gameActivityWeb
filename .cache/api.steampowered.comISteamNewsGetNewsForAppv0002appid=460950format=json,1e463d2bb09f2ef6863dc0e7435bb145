During dialogue, words can imply the pace of speech by appearing letter-by-letter or thumping on screen one word at a time. Words and phrases can be highlighted in different colours, and can further suggest intonation by animating wavily or by each letter shaking as if terrified. When in conversation, there&#8217;s a timer during every player choice, and new dialogue options might open up at different points during that countdown. You&#8217;re also able to interrupt every line said to you, whether to bypass the story or to roleplay as a rude jerk, and doing so causes the text of the person speaking to scatter like smashed glass. </p>\n<p>All of this is important, because it turns out story is as much the appeal of this 2D platformer as its propulsive, Hotlime Miami-like ultraviolence.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/25/katana-zero-review/#more-697869\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Wot I Think: Katana Zero\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n","feedlabel":"Rock, Paper, Shotgun","date":1561467601,"feedname":"rps","feed_type":0,"appid":460950},{"gid":"2400895196208970849","title":"Katana Zero cuts deep with a brutal Hard Mode update","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2400895196208970849","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Dominic Tarason)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/05/Katana-Zero-1.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/katana-zero/\">Katana Zero</a> was a lovely game &#8212; a side-scrolling samurai Hotline Miami &#8212; but perhaps a little on the short side.

And it first appears to be plenty. A side-scrolling reflexy beat &#8217;em up, painted in very pretty pixels, with a character who cannot take a hit. It&#8217;s a surprisingly interesting weakness to give your ninja-esque mass murderer, who is fast-paced, all dashes and slides, rolls and manic combat. And yet on top of that there&#8217;s the temporal meddling, some peculiarly introspective downtime, a novel and fascinating conversation system, and the fact that your incredibly vulnerable character is in fact, um, immortal.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/01/18/katana-zero-makes-time-for-more-interesting-twitch-combat/#more-634059\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Katana Zero makes time for more interesting twitch combat\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n","feedlabel":"Rock, Paper, Shotgun","date":1547823621,"feedname":"rps","feed_type":0,"appid":460950},{"gid":"2426778849012966212","title":"Katana Zero cuts to the chase in March","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2426778849012966212","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Dominic Tarason)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/01/Katana-Zero.jpg/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></p>\n<p>There are few thrills as videogamey as weaving through a barrage of very deadly bullets in slow motion. <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/katana-zero/\">Katana Zero</a> looks to have that in spades, plus the never-not-cool ability to deflect bullets with your sword, back to their unwitting owners. Askiisoft&#8217;s samurai platform slasher has been on my radar for a while now, thanks to looking like a blend of Hotline Miami and Samurai Gunn, and today&#8217;s trailer has me itching to play it. The pseudo-80s &#8216;neo-noir&#8217; aesthetic may be a well worn groove at this point, but synths, swords and slow-mo still makes a potent cocktail.
