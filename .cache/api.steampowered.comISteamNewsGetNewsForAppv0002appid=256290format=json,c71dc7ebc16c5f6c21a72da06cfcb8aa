Beneath this breezy fable of lost princesses and talking mice, however, is a complicated combat system that calls back to Final Fantasy   s Active Time Battles &#8211; a dense interplay of buffs, interrupts and attacks that injects a realtime element to otherwise turnbased fights. You might call it a platformer too, but given that the heroine quickly sprouts wings, your exploration of the sidescrolling overworld is more aerobatic than acrobatic. I like all these things and yet it   s left me struggling to be enthused. Here   s wot I think.</em></p>\n<p>The one good thing about uPlay misplacing my save file several hours into Child of Light is that it helped bring my feelings about the game into sharper focus. One feeling being a reluctance to play more of it than I really needed to.
