The Accord has deployed scientists and soldiers around the zone looking for information from this area which housed a pre-Melding weapons research facility. The Chosen and Ophanim are harassing Accord personnel and it’s the ARES Initiative’s job to defend the scientists. This world event works in three phases[/*]\r\n[*]During the first phase, pilots will find Accord personnel either captured by Chosen or Ophanim (depending whose territory they are found within), or at outposts that need to be defended. These events are scattered throughout the zone. Once a certain amount of events are complete, the second phase will begin.[/*]\r\n[*]While in the second phase, the Accord will send dropships into the zone in several different specific locations to evacuate the scientists. ARES pilots should defend these sites and evacuate as many scientists as they possibly can before the third phase begins.[/*]\r\n[*]The U.A.S. Vanguard moves in closer to the Chosen Prison and the Chosen launch an all-out attack on the Accord. There are three sites along the coast of Devil’s Tusk that house Anti-Aircraft guns which ARES Pilots will need to use to take down the Chosen ships attacking the Vanguard. At the same time, a small team of ARES Pilots will need to use dropship transports to infiltrate the Chosen Prison and evacuate the Accord personnel held prisoner there before the Chosen take out the Vanguard. [/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Note that for 1.7 we have made a change to damage resistances and there will no longer be enemies with damage type resistances. Enemies will still have vulnerabilities to certain damage types. The purpose of this change is to ensure the effect of damage types in combat is a net positive. Players should still be able to maximize their combat effectiveness by selecting the proper weapon damage type against specific enemies, at the same time players are not penalized to use weapons they enjoy.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Instances[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]New instanced mission: Homecoming, including Challenge and Hardcore versions.[/*]\r\n[*]Serkan has driven us out of Blackwater during the Razor’s Edge mission and is continuing his plans to assault the Accord and steal their arcporting technology.

This should now be improved.[/*]\r\n[*]Minor hitches when walking around should be fixed.[/*]\r\n[*]The 5-second-hitches should be completely gone. We've addressed some threading issue that could cause starvation of threads.[/*]\r\n[*]In 1.6, the appearance of UI like tutorial tips or the inventory can cause major hitches up to a few seconds. This should be fixed in 1.7. Textures are loaded in the background.[/*]\r\n[*]Textures should stream in much more quickly now. The system has been completely redone. You shouldn't notice tiles streaming anymore if you have a decent internet connection, even if you are using a HDD, not an SSD.[/*]\r\n[*]The view distance of NPCs in towns should be much higher[/*]\r\n[*]NPCs shouldn't stream in late anymore; you shouldn't be shot by invisible mobs.[/*]\r\n[*]Better recovery from device reset (changing window size, going fullscreen). Before, textures went black for a while before the game can reload them. Now it should look less broken.[/*]\r\n[*]Character levels of detail (LODs) are more stable now. Before, you could get into situations where LODs would switch even if you stand still.[/*]\r\n[*]Improved static geometry storage and streaming. This reduces install size by about 1.6 GB, memory usage by about 70 MB and improves load time. With this and other fixes, problems with out of memory crashes should be improved, albeit possibly not completely fixed.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Interface[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Bought back the radar options from 1.3 (terrain gamma, rotation, zoom etc.) except square radar which would have been hard to get back.
