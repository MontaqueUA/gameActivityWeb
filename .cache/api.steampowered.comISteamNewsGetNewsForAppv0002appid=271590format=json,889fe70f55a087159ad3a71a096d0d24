The &quot;Coming Soon&quot; signs from 2013 have finally been taken down and it is well and truly open for business. But what does the DLC entail? What can you actually do in the casino and can you make any money from it? This article will go through it all.&#xA0;</p><p>However, and probably as expected when you introduce gambling into a game that previously didn&#x2019;t have it, the introduction of the casino has not been without some controversy. With players in over <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/cgqza2/psa_countries_and_their_gambling_bans/\" target=\"_blank\">50 countries</a> (such as Argentina, Greece, Poland, Portugal, and South Korea) not able to use anything in the Casino at all due to gambling laws where they live, not everyone is going to get the same experience from this update. Those in the affected countries will find that this update is merely just a selection of new cars to buy, with many other features of the casino that will be detailed here completely locked off from being experienced.&#xA0;</p><p>For those in countries that are unaffected, read on for a complete run down of what you can do with this new update. For those in countries that are affected, keep in mind that not all of this may be possible for you.</p>\n<h3>The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The main part of the update is of course the casino itself, and Rockstar as usual has done an excellent job when it comes to modelling the exterior and interior of the swanky new building. You can drive up to the entrance and have the valet park your car for you in the new shared space that is the casino&#x2019;s parking garage, an area where multiple players can congregate away from the hustle and bustle of the city (weapons are disabled in the parking garage). There is even a beautiful rooftop terrace, however this isn&#x2019;t locked off in any way and in most public GTA Online session will likely just become a war zone.&#xA0;</p><p>Although the exterior of the casino has changed, and because of that has caused some issues for races and other jobs that were created around it, it&#x2019;s nothing in comparison to the interior. In classic casino fashion, it&#x2019;s almost like a maze where you can get lost in the bright lights, tables, slot machines, VIP rooms, bars and other people enjoying what the resort has to offer. This is also a shared space&#x2060;&#x2014;unlike the arena from the previous update, everyone who enters the casino in the same session will be in the same area, able to interact with and watch each other peacefully (again weapons are disabled).</p>\n<h3>Penthouses</h3>\n<p>What would a casino be without a place to live to keep you close to the action? The Diamond offers this in the shape of the Penthouse suite. This functions in the same way as other apartments/living spaces in the game, with each player gaining access to his own living area in which they can invite other players and customise how they see fit. A standard penthouse will set you back $1.5 million in game (a little over $20 in shark cards), with all the optional extras added, such as private blackjack table, bar, spa, arcade machines, etc bringing that price up to around $6 million instead. You can also add a single private 10 car garage to increase your overall vehicle storage capacity.&#xA0;</p><p>One thing new to this living space is the ability to customise it to hitherto unseen levels. Utilising a new casino-only currency called &#x201C;chips&#x201D; (we&#x2019;ll come on to this later) you can buy various decorations to place around the penthouse&#x2060;&#x2014;wall art, trinkets for shelves and other surfaces, even floor sculptures. The level of control in where you place these items is quite remarkable, with various spots all around the penthouse to utilise. However since those in restricted countries can&#x2019;t even buy chips to then buy items, this aspect will be locked off for those in the countries mentioned at the start of this article despite it having no gambling connotations.</p>\n<h3>Missions</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buying a penthouse gives you VIP access to the casino which raises the limits for how many chips you can buy and how much you can bet, but it also gives you access to six casino missions that must be played with 3 other players. Similar in style to Lamar&#x2019;s missions, it&#x2019;s a short story in its own right where you, as the owner of the penthouse, are helping those running the casino with some troubles they&#x2019;re having.&#xA0;</p><p>Completing them will net you $50k for the first five missions plus $100k for the last the first time they are played, and if you host them all you&#x2019;ll receive an extra $100k plus the Paragon R (Armored), which is the only way to access this new car. There are also various bonuses which get you some extra cash too, such as completing the missions in order ($500k), while being a crew member ($100k), and while not losing a life ($50k). If you&#x2019;re having trouble accessing the missions, wait until you get a call from Ms Baker from outside the casino before going to the management area inside to start each mission.</p>\n<h3>Work</h3>\n<p>If you call Ms Baker you can also request additional &#x201C;casino work&#x201D;. These consist of odd-jobs such as searching for thieves or delivering goods to the casino. There are 12 missions available but you can&#x2019;t choose which you will get. They can however all be done solo and in private sessions.</p><p>Each mission completion gives you around $5-10k and 5k chips, depending on the type of work you do. Completing 50 of them rewards you with $180k, but given how long they can take it&#x2019;s not a worthy investment from a money making perspective. You can see all the jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSKk6x60hc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cars</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>22 new vehicles were added to the game with the casino update, and only the aforementioned Paragon R (Armored) is weaponised, meaning 21 &#x201C;normal&#x201D; cars broken down into the following classes: 5 supercars, 6 sports cars, 3 muscle cars, 3 sports classics cars, 2 off-road vehicles, 1 SUV and 1 motorcycle. Although 22 cars were added with the update, only 7 are available initially, with the remaining 15 set to be released one per week in the usual drip-feed fashion for the next four months.&#xA0;</p><p>Of those that came on release day, the two new supercars (the S80RR and Thrax, which can also be won on the prize wheel) are actually very competitive for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e65nmgFj4MU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">lap time</a>, although have relatively poor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeWrsKN_iz0&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">top speeds</a>. Two of the three sports cars (the Paragon R and Issi Sport) are also impressive for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7XK1ifzkME&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">lap time</a>, but all three (including the 8F Drafter) aren&#x2019;t too special for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSNOWTsf3jk&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">top speed</a>. New cars will be tested for lap time and top speed each week on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/broughy\" target=\"_blank\">this YouTube channel</a> to see how they fare against already existing models.</p>\n<h3>Gambling</h3>\n<p><strong>Member Types&#xA0;</strong></p><p>As a normal player walking into the casino you first have to pay a small membership fee of $500. This means you become a standard member of the casino and can play the various games on the casino floor. Buying a penthouse will upgrade you to a VIP member and will give you access to high limit tables as well as higher limits on betting and buying chips.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Lucky Wheel&#xA0;</strong></p><p>In the centre of the main casino area you&#x2019;ll see a large spin wheel next to the revolving car&#x2060;&#x2014;you can spin this wheel once per 24 hours for free. Some of the potential prizes include more chips, GTA dollars, or RP as well as clothing, vehicle discounts, and a 1 in 20 chance to win the car being showcased next to the wheel!&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Chips</strong>&#xA0;</p><p>Chips are the currency of the casino. 1 chip is equivalent to 1 GTA dollar, so betting 25,000 chips is really betting $25,000. At the cashier&#x2019;s desk you can get 1,000 chips for free every 24 hours, and buy as many chips as you want with your GTA dollars up to a certain limit every in-game day (which is 48 minutes). The buying limit for standard members is 20,000 chips every 48 minutes, whereas for VIP members it&#x2019;s 50,000 chips.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Slot Machines&#xA0;</strong></p><p>There&#x2019;s not much to these. You keep hitting a button and hope you land on a combination that is a winner. With the return rate to the player being 98.7%, you will lose money playing these over the long term (although that can be said about any casino game frankly, in GTA or real life).&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Horse Racing&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Unfortunately the actual horse track that&#x2019;s located outside the back of the casino isn&#x2019;t used here. Instead you&#x2019;ll be watching virtual horses on a screen. You make your bet on one out of six horses, each with different odds of winning (the lower the chances that a horse will win, the more money you&#x2019;ll win if it does) and watch the race unfold.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Table Games&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Roulette, Blackjack and Three Card Poker are the table games available in the Diamond Casino. In roulette you&#x2019;re playing against the wheel, betting on what will come up, and in the card games you&#x2019;re playing against the dealer, trying to beat whatever hand they have with your own.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Playing Against Others&#xA0;</strong></p><p>There is no way to gamble against other players in the casino, such as with a game of Texas hold &#x2018;em poker. All games are played against the house and while you can sit with other players at the same tables, you cannot actively play against them in any of the games.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As usual with things like this if you feel like you have a gambling problem it&#x2019;s best to avoid the casino in GTA just as it would be in real life. With the same sort of hooks being used (like free daily chips and lucky wheel spins) to get you inside and spend money on the other tables, and the potential to spend upwards of 20 USD in shark card money each day buying chips to gamble with, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Broughy1322/status/1154497451480539139\" target=\"_blank\">depending on your location</a>, those who have problems may not be too pleased to see something they try to avoid being introduced to a game they may otherwise use to get away from such issues.&#xA0;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s pretty much it for GTA&#x2019;s new Diamond Casino &amp; Resort DLC update. Since there aren&#x2019;t any continual money-making opportunities in the form of businesses like we&#x2019;ve seen before with Import/Export, Gunrunning, etc. the longevity of this update is questionable. Especially given that after the missions are done there isn&#x2019;t really an awful lot to keep you involved except gambling, which a lot of people can&#x2019;t even do in the first place. Maybe that&#x2019;s for the best.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1566559824,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":271590},{"gid":"3556075649733215655","title":"Steam Charts: Do As You're Told Edition","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/3556075649733215655","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (John Walker)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/charts_dodont.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/charts_dodont.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hi, it&#8217;s me!

It's time for some payback - Weston, a marauding tycoon of the Gordon Gekko school, has double-crossed Michael and attempted to hire Franklin to kill him. But first, a little speech from Michael on the subject of the \"great evils that bedevil American capitalism\". One of these evils, he says, is offshoring - the act of moving part of your business overseas to lower costs by, for example, paying less tax in the country where you're based. </p><p>Offshoring is legal in many countries, but is widely regarded as a dirty trick, denying the society that supports you an appropriate share of your earnings - and in a moment of blunt poetic justice, Michael, Franklin and Trevor proceed to \"offshore\" Weston by rolling the car over a cliff into the Pacific Ocean. It's typical of Rockstar's brand of social satire, clownish and macabre and, in this case, spiced with hypocrisy. Six years after the game's release, the company's UK businesses <a href=\"https://www.taxwatchuk.org/reports/gaming-the-tax-system/\">stand accused by TaxWatch</a> of moving billions of dollars in profits overseas in order to avoid paying corporation tax, all the while claiming back   47.3 million via a tax relief scheme for creators of \"culturally British\" art, and doling out large bonuses to UK-based executives. It's difficult to assess that accusation without knowledge of how development of GTA5 was distributed across Rockstar's various studios, but well, I'm not sure Michael would be very forgiving.</p><p>Videogame \"satires\" of giant corporations have never rung that true for me, largely because some of the most prominent examples are developed by giant corporations. GTA aside, the field is led by Portal 2, a historical and architectural cross-section of a dysfunctional science company created by Valve, the owner of the world's largest PC game distribution platform. I don't think it's impossible to critique the upper echelons of the private sector while working for one of the Powers That Be - if I did, I wouldn't be writing this for a website owned by a million-dollar events business. But it's harder to laugh along to jokes about, say, brutal working practices or womanising CEOs when they come from those at the summit of an industry that <a href=\"https://www.takethis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TakeThis_StateOfTheIndustry_2019.pdf\">worships crunch</a> and has a lingering sexism problem.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-09-videogame-corporate-satire-is-really-overdue-an-upgrade\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1565856000,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":49520},{"gid":"2412160539873366967","title":"Take-Two boss says linking videogames to gun violence is 'disrespectful' to victims","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2412160539873366967","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p>Speaking in a recent episode of CNBC&apos;s financial talk show <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/08/12/take-two-ceo-its-disrespectful-to-pin-gun-violence-to-video-games.html?jwsource=cl\">Mad Money</a>, Take-Two Interactive chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick said the suggestion that videogames cause real-world violence is &quot;disrespectful&quot; to victims and their families.</p><p>&quot;This is a terrible tragedy, a senseless tragedy. It&apos;s fun to talk about entertainment, but lives were lost,&quot; Zelnick said. &quot;The truth is, it&apos;s disrespectful to the victims and the families to point the finger at entertainment. Entertainment is part of people&apos;s daily joy, and it&apos;s consumed worldwide, and it&apos;s the same worldwide. Gun violence is uniquely American. And that has to change, and it will only change if we address the real issues.&quot;</p><p>As the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series (among others), Zelnick knows a thing or two about campaigns to blame games for violent behavior. Take-Two was a favorite target of disgraced former attorney and anti-game crusader Jack Thompson (Thompson once ratted out Strauss to Mrs. Zelnick, and I&apos;m <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/jack-thompson-hounds-rockstar-bosss-mother/\">not making that up</a>), until Thompson agreed in a lawsuit settlement to stop threatening to sue Take Two and attempting to block the sale of its games.&#xA0;</p><p>Zelnick&apos;s comments follow a statement made earlier this month by US president Donald Trump, who in the wake of mass murders in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, called out &quot;<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/us-president-donald-trump-blames-videogames-for-fueling-violent-culture/\">grisly and violent videogames</a>&quot; for the influence they have on young people.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life.&quot;</p><p>Zelnick said that if evidence was ever found indicating that a game caused violent behavior, he would stop selling it, &quot;in the same way that I wouldn&apos;t choose to market substances that cause people to get sick.&quot;</p><p>Despite the absence of that evidence, the US government has continued with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-at-todays-white-house-meeting-on-videogame-violence/\">efforts to link videogames to gun violence</a>, instead of, for instance, guns.</p><p>Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-ceo-says-its-disrespectful-to-blame-shootings-on-games/\">VGC</a>.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1565731049,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":271590},{"gid":"2412160539868795647","title":"Steam Charts: Win A Free Car Edition!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2412160539868795647","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (John Walker)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/charts_planetfall2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/charts_planetfall2.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hello, I&#8217;m high school sweetheart, John Walker.

It doesn&apos;t require any bots or scripts: it&apos;s just about using your mouse in a certain way when placing your bet.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Be warned:</strong> We don&apos;t know if or how Rockstar will punish players for using this exploit, but <strong>you could be risking having your account banned</strong> or losing all those chips if you get busted. And it&apos;s probably not worth it, honestly, to win a bunch of fake money while you sit in a casino, though I myself have been doing it a bunch today because I&apos;m a filthy cheater.</p><p>The exploit only works with the Single Event betting option, not the Main Event (multiplayer) races. Essentially, you start the race having bet only 200 chips, but while the race is running your bet continues increasing, even though you can&apos;t see it happening. If you lose, you just lose the 200 you bet before the race started. If you win, you win whatever the maximum payout is. I just tried it this morning and it&apos;s definitely still working.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The smart thing to do is not risk your account by using this exploit. But if you <em>do</em> use it, then the smart thing to do is to bet on the #1 horse, which always has the best chance of winning. The payout won&apos;t be massive if the odds are evens or 3/1, but you&apos;ll win more often than not. With even odds you&apos;ll get 20,000 chips with each win and only lose 200 if your horse doesn&apos;t finish first.</p><p>Or, you could do what I do, which is bet on the #6 horse which usually has odds somewhere between 20/1 or 30/1. You won&apos;t win often and you&apos;ll be losing 200 each race, but when the #6 horse does win the payout is huge. I just won 270,000 on a 26/1 horse. It&apos;s a big payday for a lousy cheat like me.&#xA0;</p><p>I&apos;ll let you know if Rockstar takes away my ill-gotten winnings somehow. Proceed at your own risk for now.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1565196633,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":271590},{"gid":"2412159905944729816","title":"GTA Online's slot machines are rigged and the NPCs are winning all the damn money","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2412159905944729816","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p>I haven&apos;t been inside a real casino in years, but I remember enjoying the Wheel of Fortune slot machines. It was like any other three-reel machine, but if you got the special wheel symbol on the payline, you could then spin the big Wheel of Fortune on the top for a bonus prize. The machine would shout &quot;Wheel! Of! Fortune!&quot; and the big wheel would spin and anyone nearby would stop what they were doing to watch. A fun, satisfying, and extremely stupid way to give away your money.</p><p>As I was walking through GTA Online&apos;s new Diamond Casino yesterday, I noticed a couple of the virtual slot machines had Wheel of Fortune-style wheels built into them, too. I sat down at one called Fame or Shame to see if I could win the chance to spin the big-ass wheel. Next to me was an NPC playing a different slot, so as I sat there I watched her reels, too, to see which of us would hit three matching symbols on the payline first. Sort of like a race to pass the time.</p>\n<p>I figured I&apos;d win easily because I was spinning the reels much faster than she was&#x2014;the casino NPCs tend to react, curse, complain, look around, and fiddle with their bets between each spin. Meanwhile I hit the button as soon as possible, so I was spinning my reels about three times for every one of hers.</p><p>But she hit three sevens on her payline pretty quickly. And soon I began to notice she wasn&apos;t the only one. The casino NPCs are hitting three sevens <em>suspiciously often</em>. All of them. They&apos;re winning hundreds of thousands of dollars every couple minutes. You know who isn&apos;t? <em>Me</em>. An <em>important person</em>.</p><p>I took a few laps around the casino, peeking over the gamblers&apos; shoulders. Everywhere I went, I saw winners. And not just sevens on the payline! Below, I walk by five different gamblers and see lots of matching symbols on the payline. Three grapes. Three grapes. A miss. Three sevens. And three more sevens. At any given time, four out of five gamblers are hitting a damn jackpot. What gives?</p>\n<p>This isn&apos;t random. I played slots for two solid hours last night because in addition to having no life I wanted to gather evidence. I&apos;m not saying I never won anything&#x2014;each slot has a symbol that pays off even if you only get one or two of them, but in all that time I hit three symbols exactly once. About an hour in I got three grapes. That was it! Three lousy goddamn grapes.</p><p>At the end of the night I was down 10 grand on a slot machine with a max bet of $25.</p><p>All the AI-controlled NPCs, though? In that same period of time they won hundreds of thousand of dollars. Over and over again I&apos;d walk past a gambler or park my ass next to one of them and they&apos;d come up all sevens. Where are my sevens?</p><p>Is it a conspiracy? Are these NPCs paid by the casino to sit there and win to convince idiots (me) that these are the loosest (and only) slots in town? Are they all part of a collective of cheaters who cracked these machines&apos; algorithms and know how to hit the jackpot 25% of the time and won&apos;t tell me how they do it? Did one of my many, many deaths in GTA Online deliver me to hell, like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nice_Place_to_Visit\" target=\"_blank\"> in that Twilight Zone episode</a>, but instead of me always winning, everyone else is always winning? (Note to the writer of that episode: that would be a much more punishing version of hell. Oh, wait, the writer of that episode died in 1967. Disregard.)</p>\n<p>Lost in this frustrating slot machine conspiracy is the fact that I never got the chance to spin the Fame or Shame wheel and win a shirt or a watch or whatever prize it dispatches. You need to get three golden microphones on the payline to spin it, and I never got those. I also never got three sevens or three melons or three bells. Just those three measly grapes, <em>once,</em> in two hours.</p><p>Well, if you can&apos;t beat &apos;em, join &apos;em! I&apos;ve been strolling around in a white suit, white shoes, a white scarf and a white top hat&#x2014;decidedly un-NPC-like. This morning I buy myself a standard NPC outfit, and drive back in a dull brown car, obeying all the traffic rules like an obedient AI.</p><p>I buy a sensible 500 chips from the cashier&#x2014;not the usual 50,000 some high-falutin&apos; player character might. I stand around in a cluster of NPCs for a bit, blending in, then pretend to notice an interesting looking slot machine for the first time.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;Fame or Shame? Say, that sounds like a lark! Maybe I will give it a try! Excuse me, fellow automatons, I&apos;ll be right back.&quot; I walk nonchalantly over, glancing at at NPC sitting nearby (of course she has just hit triple sevens) and give the reels a spin.</p>\n<p>Huh. Triple cherries. Just like that. What took me two hours last night, I just accomplished in a single spin.</p><p>It ain&apos;t triple sevens&#x2014;frankly, it&apos;s not even as good as triple grapes&#x2014;and I still haven&apos;t gotten to spin the Fame or Shame Wheel. But it&apos;s an instant win for this fake NPC. Maybe I&apos;m onto something.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1565115061,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":271590},{"gid":"2412159905929528512","title":"GTA Online's casino update brought in the most players since launch","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2412159905929528512","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-casino-release-date/\" target=\"_blank\">GTA Online&apos;s Diamond Casino</a> has proved to be a popular destination.

The roulette is handled well but personally I find watching a ball spin around a real bore. There&apos;s a cap on how many chips you can buy&#x2014;20,000 for walk-ins and 50,000 for VIP members. Honestly, this is probably a good idea, since you can buy casino chips with GTA cash, and you can buy GTA cash for real money, making this fake gambling, potentially, real gambling.</p><p>At the same time, though, this is a game where most players are in-game multi-millionaires, and it&apos;s hard to feel like a high-roller when you&apos;re limited to a relatively small pile of chips.</p><p>Mainly though, I&apos;m severely disappointed in the horses and the poker.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I get why the horse racing sucks and looks fake: it&apos;s a throwback to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHR-BVoQBBQ\" target=\"_blank\">the original Inside Track from GTA: San Andreas</a>. Inside Track is a betting shop where CJ can put some money on the ponies, and then watch the side-scrolling race on a TV monitor. This is exactly that: janky looking horses racing from left to right and shifting positions, like the carnival game where you shoot a stream of water into a target to make your horse move.&#xA0;</p><p>And it&apos;s cute, don&apos;t get me wrong. But it&apos;s hard to watch the horse races at The Diamond without thinking about the thousands of hours of programming and animation that went into the horses in Rockstar&apos;s other big game: Red Dead Redemption 2.&#xA0;</p><p>All I can think is, hey, why not get those beautiful ponies in here? GTA and RDR are both cinematic experiences. Real horse racing is dreadfully exciting (if you can try not to focus on the horses getting beaten by their jockeys while they run). So, why I am watching a shitty side-scrolling horse race and not a beautiful, dramatic, cinematic, realistic horse race? Because of a throwback joke? If we can&apos;t get RDR2 on PC, can&apos;t we at least look at its horses?&#xA0;</p><p>I&apos;ll grant that I&apos;m making it sound simple when it&apos;s obviously not as easy as typing &apos;import RDR2_horses; set DoACoolRace==true,&apos; but watching all the horsing around in RDR2 makes a person envious.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even if you like the janky new Inside Track, I think we can all agree that GTA Online&apos;s poker just 100 percent completely sucks a butt. It&apos;s Three Card Poker. <em>Three Card Poker</em>. What the hell? Three Card Poker isn&apos;t a terrible game in and of itself, but RDR2 has actual Texas Hold &apos;Em. I marched into The Diamond expecting to sit down at a proper poker table in a proper poker room and lose all my money. I am incredibly disappointed (though I still lost all my money).</p><p>I haven&apos;t played RDR2 myself, but I played Red Dead Redemption and its poker was great. I used to fire up the game and play it for hours <em>just </em>for the poker. I can only assume RDR2&apos;s Texas Hold &apos;Em (which was made available in Red Dead Online a couple months ago) is good, too.</p><p>So why the heck isn&apos;t it in The Diamond, along with some sweet ponies to watch?
