The update doesn't add much, mostly fixing some tiny, tiny bugs. However, there's some underlying stuff that has changed and that'll help future patches a lot. That is, I've replaced certain code that wasn't working anymore and that prevented the game from being updated. It took a long time, but now that's taken care of! There probably isn't all that much patching to happen with ESA anymore, but nevertheless I prefer having the option to do so.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8213706/83c5146a56a26026fdd972851c045cd350e8f027.gif[/img]","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1531441253,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":350070},{"gid":"2363697377454036021","title":"Malwarebytes issue resolved","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2363697377454036021","is_external_url":true,"author":"Hempuli","contents":"Just wanted to post a quick announcement that the false positive report from Malwarebytes Anti-Malware will be fixed in the next update of MBAM.

Basically all underwater/hot areas (i.e. areas with a wavy effect) appeared completely black on my computer. Since the effect was done via a plug-in, my options seemed to be either to remove the effect entirely or re-do it from scratch. I opted for the latter but due to working on ESA 2 (and later Baba Is You) the re-do ended up being a much more demotivating task than what I expected.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the game is still unupdated because of this, but I plan to finally fix the problem and get the game to a patchable state again. I wanted to say this to explain why some bugs are still unfixed (even though I claimed to fix them).\r\n\r\nThe other thing relates to some recent posts about Malwarebytes Anti-Malware reporting ESA's files as Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs). I noticed that the party developing MAM had reported going to be stricter with PUP detection in the future, so this issue is probably a side-effect of that. In the past the AVG anti-virus program also briefly considered games made with the same tool as ESA to be harmful.\r\n\r\nI'll contact Malwarebytes about this and hopefully the issue will be resolved soon.\r\n\r\nSorry on both of these accounts and thank you very much for your patience! I hope ESA 2 will be able to deliver more of what you enjoyed in ESA (in case you did in fact enjoy ESA!)","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1518126424,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":350070},{"gid":"243582192044745647","title":"Environmental Station Alpha in the Humble Clickteam Fusion Bundle!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/243582192044745647","is_external_url":true,"author":"Hempuli","contents":"Environmental Station Alpha is featured right now in the Humble Clickteam Fusion Bundle along with several really cool games made with Clickteam programs.
