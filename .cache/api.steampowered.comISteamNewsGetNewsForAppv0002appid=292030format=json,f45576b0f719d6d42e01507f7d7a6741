But the primary driver behind the company&apos;s financial performance is actually <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-witcher-3-mods/\">The Witcher 3</a>, despite the fact that it was released more than four years ago.</p><p>&quot;Our financial result for the first half of the year was again mainly affected by sales of The Witcher 3, which remain strong. This further confirms our belief that investing in top-quality games pays off, and that such games may continue to sell well for many years,&quot; CD Projekt CFO Piotr Nielubowicz <a href=\"https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-looks-back-at-the-first-half-of-2019/\">said</a>. &quot;In the first half of 2019 gamers actually purchased more copies of The Witcher 3 than during the first half of the previous year!&quot;</p><p>CD Projekt has also continued to grow over the first half of the year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2019/08/management-board-report-on-cd-projekt-capital-group-activities-in-h1-2019-1.pdf\">management board report</a>: There were 953 employees at the company as of June 30, 2019, up from 887 at the end of 2018. CD Projekt Red accounts for 777 (up from 698), while GOG is down slightly, from 189 at the end of 2018 to 176 on June 30 of this year. CD Projekt said the increase &quot;is mostly due to the upscaling of business and development activities.&quot;</p><p>But what might be most interesting is the suggestion that more Gwent-style spinoff projects are in the works&#x2014;and that we haven&apos;t seen the end of The Witcher, either.</p><p>&quot;Managing two separate major franchises (The Witcher and Cyberpunk), along with several independent development teams, enables the Company to conduct parallel work on several projects and smoothens its long-term release schedule,&quot; it states. &quot;This migration towards a dual-franchise model supported by several independent product lines also permits optimization of manufacturing and financial activities, mitigates important risk factors and makes it easier for Company employees to seek professional fulfillment.&quot;</p><p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming to the Nintendo Switch in October, but given that the original was released in May 2015, that on its own hardly seems enough to maintain CD Projekt&apos;s status as a &quot;dual franchise&quot; company.

And while we already know all about when the show takes place and who it stars, the trailer marks the first time we&#x2019;ve seen everything in action.</p><p>So much happens in the trailer&apos;s meager two minutes, so unless you&apos;re scrutinizing every frame, odds are you&apos;re going to miss some stuff. We&#x2019;ve combed the trailer ourselves and turned to the internet to pull out as many interesting character reveals, plot details, and references to the Witcher books as possible.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Is Yennefer OK?</h3>\n<p>Early glimpses of Yennefer in the trailer depict a woman hunched over with a swollen cheek. That&#x2019;s the norm for plenty of sorceresses in the world of the Witcher, who often become students of magic due to varying physical irregularities. Yennefer is no different. She, like many magic users, becomes beautiful through the use of magical glamours that mask her actual appearance. Looks like we&#x2019;ll get to see her transformation in the show.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Hey, it&#x2019;s the Isle of Thanedd!</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&#x2019;s where sorceresses go to magic school, including Ciri for a bit. It&#x2019;s also the setting for some big betrayals and terrific violence. I can&#x2019;t wait to see how the show interprets those big beats.</p>\n<h3>What&#x2019;s up with that wacky purple tree in the desert?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>At first glance, I thought this was a scene from Ciri&#x2019;s trip to the Frying Pan, which feels too far off to plop into season one. I wasn&#x2019;t alone in my thinking either, but, twist! Showrunner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LHissrich/status/1152351699178151936?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren Hissrich confirmed</a> the purple desert tree is not related to the arc depicted in Time of Contempt. Get to making those theories.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>The Dryads aren&#x2019;t bright green, thank goodness</h3>\n<p>The Witcher show is taking a simple approach to its depiction of Dryads, the nymph-like humanoids that live in the forests of Brokilon. The games tend to depict them as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=dryads+witcher+games&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS824US824&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNxYjzsMnjAhWQCXwKHT4fDPkQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=1156&amp;bih=1169#imgrc=9PJhLBCw9NFwvM:\"><u>nude green plant people</u></a>, but the books describe them as very human-like with slightly greenish tints to their skin tone. The show is definitely leaning towards the latter.</p>\n<h3>That&#x2019;s a Striga</h3>\n<p>A few quick clips depict Geralt going at it with a grimy humanoid, likely a Striga, which is one of the first monsters he dukes it out with in The Witcher short stories. Striga are women transformed into beastly monsters via a curse, something like a werewolf with hints of troll. Geralt dreams of his fight with the Striga in The Voice of Reason, the opening story in The Last Wish collection. And he dreams of it after some good sex. That&#x2019;s our guy.</p>\n<h3>And that&#x2019;s a Kikimora</h3>\n<p>There&#x2019;s some debate over what that swamp spider is in the last shot of the trailer, but I&#x2019;m banking on a <a href=\"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Kikimore\"><u>Kikimora</u></a>, monsters known to live underground or in, get this, swamps. It&#x2019;s also one of the monsters he kills in the short stories before bringing it to Blaviken, where Geralt starts a major beef with just about everyone&#x2014;on accident, of course.</p>\n<h3>Meet the Butcher of Blaviken</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/cg4efe/these_shots_of_geralt_in_what_i_presume_is/\"><u>As this thread points out</u></a>, when he looks all tore up and pissed may well be a formative scene set in Blaviken that earns Geralt a lifelong nickname: The Butcher of Blaviken. We&#x2019;ll leave the show to tell the tale if you&#x2019;re not aware, but it&#x2019;s a classic bit where Geralt, ever the neutral, gets screwed over by everyone in an attempt to save everyone. Needless to say, a lot of people die, the blame gets pinned on Geralt, and he becomes feared throughout the continent. Poor guy.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Our boy&#x2019;s casting Aard</h3>\n<p>Either Geralt&#x2019;s getting about to blind a three-eyed monster or that boy&#x2019;s casting the Aard sign. If you&#x2019;re unfamiliar, witchers dabble in magic, much to the dismay of sorcerers who view the witchers&#x2019; practice as clumsy and contrived. But whatever, because Henry-Geralt is about to send someone flying across the room like a hot Jedi.</p>\n<h3>Emhyr the Hedgehog says hello</h3>\n<p>Here&#x2019;s one that most people missed (including me). Some sharp-eyed folks in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/cffpdn/the_witcher_teaser_discussion_thread_spoilers/euacbqt/\"><u>this Reddit thread</u></a> might&#x2019;ve spotted a quick glimpse of the future Emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis. See, before the imposing bastard become a tyrant, he was cursed by a sorcerer to take on the appearance of a human-hedgehog hybrid. The curse did not make him go fast, unfortunately. We&#x2019;ll leave the rest to the show since lifting the curse is its own adventure, but clearly, he doesn&#x2019;t stay that way forever. Until we see how the show depicts Emhyr&#x2019;s origins, all you really need to know is that the whole ordeal does not make him a cool, chill guy.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1563832257,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":292030},{"gid":"2413284533099160242","title":"Netflix's first trailer for The Witcher shows off sword fights and magic","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2413284533099160242","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Jay Castello)","contents":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/07/Witcher-Netflix.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" />\nEveryone   s old <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/the-witcher/\">Witcher</a> pal Geralt of Rivia is approaching his Netflix debut, and a trailer premiered at San Diego Comic-Con is here to prove it.

To the question, &quot;So that&apos;s all life is to you? Monsters and money?&quot; Geralt responds with the very, very dramatic: &quot;It&apos;s all it needs to be.&quot; He also gets very dirty at some point, so hopefully there&apos;s a tub nearby:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The trailer hints at a few different storylines: the cultural clash between humans and elves, the political feuds with Nilfgaard, and the connections between our three protagonists.

We see the Nilfgaardian army coursing over a hilltop in the style of epic Lord of the Rings cinematic battles. Yennefer, after undergoing a fiery transformation, lays bedridden and begs Ciri to go and find Geralt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The first season seems like it will revolve around the dangers and temptations of magic as we see Ciri surrounded by elves, out beneath that magical purple tree, and throwing a room full of courtiers to their feet in a fit of rage. &quot;Without control, chaos will kill you,&quot; one character says of the underlying magical force. It may be that the premier season of The Witcher on Netflix will revolve around Geralt and Yennefer mentoring Ciri through her discovery of her own abilities.&#xA0;</p><p>The Witcher series will come out later this year, and until then we can pick apart this trailer for more info.&#xA0;</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1563574842,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":292030},{"gid":"2413284533095958583","title":"This Witcher 3 HD texture mod is impressive?","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2413284533095958583","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Matt Cox)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/07/Witchermodheader.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/07/Witchermodheader.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>A sharper, more detailed version of a <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/\">Witcher 3</a> texture overhaul mod came out two days ago.
