The biggest change is that online multiplayer is increasing from the previous two player limit. Let's go through the changes one by one.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/5d50649a104beab65c95c9405b8b04ed6590bce3.png[/img]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, [b]Ranked Matches[/b] have been reworked from the December 2018 Update. The first improvement is that the matchmaking has been updated. It will now match you with players in the same tier as you. (example: Bronze to Bronze. Gold to Gold. etc.) After a short period of time, it will expand to one tier above and one tier below you but you can't match with someone past that.\r\n\r\nWe like the star system and ranking up from the 2018 update, but we didn't like how it discourages people from playing their secondaries when they reach a high ranking because you are more likely to lose on your secondary. So we have made a ranking system for each character including random. Ranking up each character will be part of the fun! Each tier will have a different reward. Rank up to Silver to get the first Emote for your character. Rank up to Gold to get your character's Ranked Skin!\r\n\r\nRanked remains a best 2 out of 3. And yes, you can still counter-pick. But you can only change to a character within the same tier or lower than the character that you queued up with initially. Stars will be awarded to the character that won the last game in the set and losses will be awarded to the character that started the search.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/39b771ff09caab415764af61cd56ccd4fdf03e9b.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNext, [b]Casual Matches[/b] have been updated and overhauled now that lobbies have increased past our previous 2 player limit. Casual Matchmaking allows for you to search for three types of Casual Matches - 1v1, 2v2 and Free-for-All. You can even queue up for all three options at once! Casual Matches remain best 2 out of 3. When playing Free-for-All, the set ends when one player reaches 2 wins, so can continue past 3 matches. Both Casual 2v2 and Casual Free-for-All require four players in order to for the set to begin. If one player leaves then the remaining players search for a replacement and start a new set after finding one.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/922a45893395920a19a4584664ad0ece88d097d4.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNext up, [b]Friendly Matches[/b] have been improved as well. The biggest change is the lobby size has increased not just to 4 players but you can have even more spectators. This allows players to spectate even 2v2 matches or do rotations while their friends play. You can also turn on Teams in Friendly Matches at any time as long as all players in the lobby agree. Friendly Lobbies will be the place to go to get either casual or competitive matches with your friends.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/36c4287da791c000b1bc2613f2518f179b2bbd5b.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNext up we have improved the [b]Online Settings[/b] for online play. The biggest change is that [b]Regions[/b] now determine your matchmaking settings. By default, all regions will be able to be matched with you, but you can turn off any region other than your own. Be warned, lowering your region options can greatly increase your search times!\r\n\r\nNext we have added a new feature called [b]Wi-fi Mode[/b]. If you have played Rivals of Aether extensively, you will notice that the New Netcode has better ping and smoother connections than the past. However, this can cause issues if you have an erratic connection such as a wireless connection. If you experience lag spikes, you can turn on Wi-fi Mode in the settings which should have your connection function similarly to the old Netcode. When the setting is on, your input lag will increase but the connection should be more stable and be less susceptible to lag spikes. Only turn on Wi-fi Mode if you are having issues with lag spikes as it will increase your input lag when playing online.\r\n\r\n[h1]Where's Rollback?![/h1]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/ffc1f41f6353c9ff06f5ac0b5b76026b37849961.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIf you have been following the development of Rivals, you would know over 2 years ago, we announced that we were working on [url=https://medium.com/@fornace/rivals-of-aether-2017-developer-recap-2018-developer-preview-53c57417b51]rollback netcode[/url]. If you are unfamiliar with rollback netcode, you can read more about it [url=https://medium.com/@meseta/netcode-concepts-part-3-lockstep-and-rollback-f70e9297271]here[/url]. Since then, we have been working on redoing the netcode in tandem with all our other development. We made a ton of progress thanks to [url=https://twitter.com/YellowAfterlife]YellowAfterlife[/url], [url=https://twitter.com/ampersandbear]Ampersandbear[/url] and [url=https://twitter.com/jujuadams]Juju Adams[/url]. You can thank them for all the improvements you see in the above section. We did make a lot of progress toward getting rollback working with Rivals. We got the game state to be saving and loading correctly without desyncing. But we weren't close to having the save and load times small enough to run smoothly. The game was running around 1-2 frames per second initially.\r\n\r\nThanks to YellowAfterlife and Juju, we were able to optimize the game a lot over a couple of months and managed to get the frame rate up to 55-60 FPS on PC. But this still wasn't functional because we still needed the game to be able to run multiple game logic frames in a single frame in order to roll back and we were right up against the edge . The months were flying by and while we made great progress, the steps to get where we wanted were uncertain. We had to make a call if we were ever going to get the Definitive Edition actually released. The netcode revamp had already consumed a ton of development time. We decided to stop working on rollback and continue developing the new netcode using a lock-step solution similar to the old Rivals netcode.\r\n\r\nBut it's not all doom and gloom. The optimizations that we made really do improve the game and help it run on Switch much more smoothly. All those improvements are still on this branch. They might result in some new gameplay bugs that we don't see on live, but we'll get those stomped out during this open beta. Even without Rollback, the gameplay itself does feel way smoother on the New Netcode and I hope you all find good matches with low ping!","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1565991359,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":383980},{"gid":"2436926440586315458","title":"Make Your Mark: Panda Etalus","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2436926440586315458","is_external_url":true,"author":"Etalus","contents":"Events with the Make your Mark banner offer a prize like no other - a chance for the winner to get their very own skin in the game.

Each stop on the circuit promises new cities, more games, high quality production, and the biggest stages for Rivals players to compete on. This year we’ve continued the tradition of representing our community alongside the greater FGC, and have even expanded to some exciting new events to keep tournaments bigger and better.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/2b5367a384b81a1b2c44b183a034b17aa55d78ff.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThis season also features much fewer online events than previous years. While online events are easy to join, we've heard loud and clear that players prefer the competitive integrity of offline events for the official circuit. The ones we do feature on the circuit this year will be huge, but not a place to get your weekly or monthly tournament fix like previous seasons. Make sure to [url=https://discord.gg/RoA]visit our discord server[/url] and check out the tournament section for more casual daily online events.\r\n\r\nFinally, one other notable reason we’ve slimmed down our event schedule is to allow the flourishing grassroots scene [url=https://smash.gg/league/grassroots-league/details]room to grow[/url]. This is something we’ve been honored and humbled to see happening, and this year seemed like the right time to let these events really come into their own. These are events where Rivals is the focus, the schedule is dedicated to it, the stream is dedicated to it, and the fans are coming out for it - so make sure to support these events when you can.\r\n\r\nWe hope you're excited to watch and attend our events this year! Let us know what you think of the schedule in the comments below.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1559695338,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":383980},{"gid":"2905297189252352331","title":"Russian and Custom Language Support","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2905297189252352331","is_external_url":true,"author":"Etalus","contents":"Привет, русскоязычное комьюнити 🙂 Как вы уже поняли из заголовка этого поста, Rivals of Aether наконец-то переведена на русский! Идея перевода родилась как только меня пригласили в команду в сентябре прошлого года – программировать интерфейсы и интегрировать Steam Workshop. Я всегда мечтал перевести что-то крутое на русский, а Rivals of Aether оказалось не просто крутой, но по-настоящему офигенной, так что энтузиазм захлестнул меня с головой. И, как обычно бывает, его хватило на несколько дней. Дальше началась рутина, нехватка времени, нехватка мотивации, технические проблемы и далее по списку. К счастью, мне удалось закончить перевод, хоть и спустя чудовищный промежуток времени; надеюсь это будет поводом для вас снова запустить игру и пригласить в нее ваших друзей. И да, я ни в коем случае не профессиональный переводчик, а перевод никак не тестировался до этого момента, так что возможны ошибки. Даже грубые. Пожалуйста, сообщайте о них по почте (contact[at]rivalsofaether[dot]com) или в социальных сетях.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/ef4aab5c412f7129db065e707f360518d7509a4b.png[/img]\r\n\r\nRivals of Aether now includes Russian as a language option! Localized by our very own team member Nick ([url=https://twitter.com/ampersandbear]ampersandbear[/url]), you can access it by navigating to options > display > language in the settings.\r\n\r\nSince this localization is something Nick has been working on in addition to normal development tasks, we’re including it as a “beta” version. As we get closer to open support for other translations we welcome our Russian speaking community to play this version and offer your feedback. If you have any improvements or comments to share please send them to contact[at]rivalsofaether[dot]com, or contact us through any of our social media.\r\n\r\n[h1]Custom Language Support[/h1]\r\nAttentive players might also have noticed that we now have a “Custom” option listed in the language settings after Russian. This allows you to add your own localizations.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/1bbb216b0a0e7317241b117396057be7694ac35e.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThis custom language is completely editable by you and controlled through a file we’ve included in the game’s directory. Since external language support is currently under development (as mentioned above), not all text characters may display properly yet. You can reference one of our LOC files and edit the LOC_CUSTOM file to begin your own localization.\r\n\r\n[b]To get started:[/b]\r\n1. Right click on Rivals of Aether in your Steam library and select “Properties”.\r\n2. In the “LOCAL FILES” tab select “BROWSE LOCAL FILES…”.\r\n3. Open up “LOC_CUSTOM.txt” and one of our “LOC” files (EN,JP,RU) for reference in your favorite text editor.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to see what people do with this, so feel free to reach out to us and share any translations you’re working on.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1558127728,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":383980},{"gid":"2905297189252178906","title":"Hotfix 1.4.12","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2905297189252178906","is_external_url":true,"author":"Etalus","contents":"[i]Here's a little hotfix before [url=https://smash.gg/tournament/smash-n-splash-5/details]Smash'N'Splash 5[/url], wrapping in a few Sylvanos and Elliana changes we've been testing along with some fixes for a few strange interactions.[/i] \r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/cdb1cccc3a74884bb13b0054e2fd1652c4809613.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]The results screen will no longer ignore Forsburn's victories on The Forest Floor.[/*]\r\n[*]Run stop can no longer be cancelled into initial dash on the first 2 frames.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/e6985d66aed6aaf049cae48ad48623a7c92edbee.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]After parrying an attack that breaks pillar, buffering a double jump will no longer cause you to fall downward while wasting your double jump.[/*]\r\n[*]Hitting a pillar/rock immediately after hitting a pillar/rock will now refresh the jump-cancel window properly.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/514a56cf96f2f828c3c024359acc533ccb7afb89.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Team-up Fstrong back hitbox shrunk horizontally (still reaches the same distance backward, just not as far forward).[/*]\r\n[*]Team-up Fstrong back hitbox now has priority over the front hitbox.\r\n\r\n[i]The back hit pulls enemies forward, while the front hit does not, so this makes it link more reliably at ranges where the enemy would have previously been clipped by the back edge of the front hitbox.[/i][/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/f6997a0a15d00128a3f7b6df78bb8f9f3ac9bcb4.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Ftilt now only spawns a projectile if you hit a flower with it, destroying the flower.[/*]\r\n[*]Ftilt projectile base knockback increased from 0 > 6.[/*]\r\n[*]Ftilt projectile now spawns grass under it as it travels.[/*]\r\n[*]Ftilt projectile now causes extended parry stun when parried.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/10071875/3b20a373a384d7332cc2c910996cb53a47f1ab0c.png[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Nspecial's fist can no longer be broken by projectiles that deal less than 8%.[/*]\r\n[*]When landing after Uspecial, Elliana will have 99% heat that quickly drains over 8 frames.[/*]\r\n[/list]","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1558123582,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":383980,"tags":["patchnotes"]},{"gid":"2404270358324005338","title":"Patch 1.4.11 - Change of Scenery","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2404270358324005338","is_external_url":true,"author":"Etalus","contents":"In this patch it's all about location, location, location.

The second hit lingers for a while and has relatively strong knockback that decays drastically over time, allowing for varied usage depending on how you land it.
