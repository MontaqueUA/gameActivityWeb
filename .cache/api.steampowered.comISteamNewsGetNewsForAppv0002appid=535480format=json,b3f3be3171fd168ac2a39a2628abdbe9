We’re super stoked to finally reveal the project we’ve been lovingly crafting over the past 18 months or so. Behold [i]Spiritfarer[/i]: a cozy management game about dying.\r\n\r\nQueue our first trailer and prepare thyselves for the feels!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnuEvePlxWI\r\n\r\n[i]Spiritfarer [/i]is a project that’s near and dear to our hearts. Here’s the basic pitch:\r\n\r\nIn [i]Spiritfarer[/i], you play Stella, ferrymaster to the deceased. Build a boat to explore the world, then befriend and care for spirits before finally releasing them into the afterlife. Farm, mine, fish, harvest, cook, and craft your way across mystical seas. Join the adventure as Daffodil the cat, in two-player cooperative play. Spend relaxing quality time with your spirit passengers, create lasting memories, and, ultimately, learn how to say goodbye to your cherished friends.\r\n\r\nExpect a release next year on Steam, as well as with Xbox Game Pass for PC and Console, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch!\r\n\r\nWe can’t wait to tell you more about the game over the next few days, weeks, and months.\r\n\r\nToday, as I write this, we’re enjoying the frenzy of [b]E3 2019[/b], where we’ve been invited by the good people at Microsoft to present the first playable demo of [i]Spiritfarer [/i]as part of their E3 activities. Come say hi at the Microsoft Theater if you’re in town for the convention! If not, maybe we’re coming to another con near you over the next few months, hmm? \r\n\r\nStay tuned (and do please [b]Follow [/b]or Wishlist [i]Spiritfarer[/i])!\r\n\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/972660/Spiritfarer/\r\n\r\nBack to you soon with more Spiritfarer news!\r\n\r\nCheers y’all,\r\n\r\n– Rodrigue and the Thunder Lotus team","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1560118618,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":535480},{"gid":"2905297189262562059","title":"Daily Deal - Sundered : Eldritch Edition, 75% Off","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/news/51050/","is_external_url":false,"author":"Valve","contents":"Today's Deal: Save 75% on <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/app/535480/'>Sundered&reg;: Eldritch Edition</a>!*<br><br>Look for the deals each day on the front page of Steam.

Customers that purchase the Bundle will pay for, and receive, just the titles that they don’t already have in their Steam library, and a [b]20% discount[/b] will be applied to the total. In other words, this Bundle rewards your exquisite taste in games by letting you “complete your collection” and get a nice bonus discount on [i]titles you were always tempted to get, but never got around to it.[/i]\r\n\r\nThat’s right, I did say [b]bonus discount[/b] – because from now until this Friday, June 8th, each one of the titles in the Bundle are already discounted for Midweek Madness. [i]Dead Cells[/i] will feature an additional [b]33%[/b] discount, while [i]Guacamelee!

It contains four of the best games in the [spoiler]genre-that-shall-not-be-named[/spoiler]: [i]Dead Cells[/i] by Motion Twin, [i]Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition[/i] by DrinkBox Studios, [i]Salt and Sanctuary[/i] by Ska Studios, and [i]Sundered[/i] by Thunder Lotus Games… hey, that’s [b]US[/b]!\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with how bundles work on Steam, Steam doesn’t force you to re-buy the games you already have. Customers that purchase the Bundle will pay for, and receive, just the titles that they don’t already have in their Steam library, and a [b]20% discount[/b] will be applied to the total. In other words, this Bundle rewards your exquisite taste in games by letting you “complete your collection” and get a nice bonus discount on [i]titles you were always tempted to get, but never got around to it.[/i]\r\n\r\nThat’s right, I did say [b]bonus discount[/b] – because from now until this Friday, June 8th, each one of the titles in the Bundle are already discounted for Midweek Madness. [i]Dead Cells[/i] will feature an additional [b]33%[/b] discount, while [i]Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition, Salt and Sanctuary[/i], and [i]Sundered[/i] will be discounted by an additional [b]40%[/b]. Again, the 20% Bundle discount gets applied [b]on top[/b] of those discounts, which sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me!\r\n\r\nCheck out the “Not-A-Metroidvania” Bundle [url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/7135/Not_a_Metroidvania/] HERE [/url].\r\n\r\nHave a great week, y’all!\r\n\r\n– Rodrigue and the Thunder Lotus Team","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1528219086,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":535480},{"gid":"2394103650892196697","title":"Jotun is out NOW on Nintendo Switch!","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2394103650892196697","is_external_url":true,"author":"batsalient","contents":"[h1]Take it outside!

Happily, the Switch has the horsepower to showcase [i]Jotun[/i] in all its hand-drawn glory, even in handheld mode, so those who played the Wii U version especially will notice the great job the team has done remastering the graphics for the Switch release. \r\n\r\nAlso, since we play a lot with scale in [i]Jotun,[/i] Thora often being dwarfed by titanic bosses, we had to rework some of the gameplay to allow for play on a potentially much smaller screen. \r\n\r\n[h1]Keep your eyes on our social channels for a chance to win!  [/h1]\r\n\r\nWe hope you're all stoked to play the game on the Switch and, say, to beat Valhalla Mode without using God Powers *while commuting to work*!  \r\n\r\nWe're so happy to finally have one of our games on the Switch that [b]we'll be holding drawings to win Jotun Switch codes and other sweet goodies!

Jotun is out on Switch in two weeks! \r\n\r\n[h1]What's happening with Sundered?[/h1]\r\n\r\nThat's a very good question, Bill! \r\n\r\nThe team remains hard at work lovingly polishing delicious DLC for the game. I can confirm that said DLC has been content-complete for a few weeks (and that it's awesome), but we're still tweaking it 'til it's up to your/our standards of excellence. We're tantalizingly close to being able to share [i]Sundered [/i]news with you - news that goes beyond the DLC itself. If I say anymore, I'll be summarily killed.

There’s nothing like the feeling of jumping off a cliff without a parachute.\r\n\r\nAnd we made it.\r\n\r\nWe’re thankful for all of you who believed in us and supported us and the game. [b]Thank you all[/b] for giving [i]Sundered[/i] a chance.\r\n\r\nWe are extremely proud of the game we created, produced and shipped. I feel the game is unique and challenging and, once you get the hang of it, really fun. I hope [i]Sundered[/i] is a game you will remember for a long time.\r\n\r\nAt launch, we had some hiccups. Some of them due to excessive difficulty. We fixed that almost immediately. We’re experiencing technical difficulties on PS4. We’re fixing them. The game’s first loading is too long. We’re fixing it. Exploration doesn’t have enough variety. We’re fixing that too.\r\n\r\nSome of you don’t like the hordes. We’re not changing them. Several of you came in with expectations of a classic Metroidvania. We are sorry for the confusion, but we won’t be changing fundamental game systems. [i]Sundered[/i] is what is it is and that’s why we love it and are proud of it.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future, you can expect continued support. Be it additional content, bug fixes or quality-of-life improvements. [i]Sundered[/i] has tons of potential. Seeing some of you put in over 50 hours into the game within a single week is extremely satisfying and humbling.
