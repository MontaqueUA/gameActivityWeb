Then, upon arrival at your mysterious (procedurally generated) destination, it becomes a game of carefully managing your limited food and resources as you blunder across the hex-based map, encountering the likes of ancient temples, increasingly unimpressed locals, and deadly fauna along the way - the latter of which can be battled via a kind of dice-tossing mini-game.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-04-rogue-like-exploration-adventure-the-curious-expedition-is-getting-a-sequel\">Read more</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1551736920,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":358130},{"gid":"2534869043318667473","title":"Curious Expedition 2 ventures forth later this year","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2534869043318667473","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Alice O'Connor)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/03/curious-expedition-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/03/curious-expedition-2.jpg/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>German studio Maschinen-Mensch have announced <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/curious-expedition-2\">Curious Expedition 2</a>, a follow-up to the 19th century explore &#8217;em up we declared <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/06/best-roguelike-2016/\">our favourite roguelike(like) of 2016</a>.

Steam is not required for mods though\r\n  [*] No coding required! We have a simple text format which allows to add any new content. These are the same tools that we  used during development. Add items, characters, enemies, dice, statuses, events, worlds and much more. We went through all our scripts and made sure that they have nice entry points for being moddable.\r\n  [*] We made all of our text and image content open source. You can see it at https://github.com/Maschinen-Mensch/curiousexpedition and use it as inspiration for your own mods or games  \r\n  [*] Access lots of ingame debugging tools which allow you to spawn any entity or run any event on the fly. We actually improved the dev tools so much beyond of what we used during development that we are bit jealous of you now (it's fine though)\r\n  [*] We're shipping the game with multiple example mods (including the t-rex, scientific assistant and yakul mods)\r\n  [*] We've prepared extensive wiki documentation and tutorials for you to check out at http://curious-expedition.wikia.com/wiki/Modding:Home. If you have more questions also please join our discord server https://discord.gg/maschinen-mensch and chat with us and other modders directly\r\n  [*] We created a free extension for the free Visual Studio Code text editor. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download the editor and enter TCE Script in the extension settings to download our plugin.
