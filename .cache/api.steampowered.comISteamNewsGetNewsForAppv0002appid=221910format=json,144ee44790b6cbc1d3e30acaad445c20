You can </em><a href=\"https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/gaming/edge-magazine-subscription/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>subscribe in print or digital by clicking here</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p><p>This is the story of a man named Stanley. It&#x2019;s also the story of a player named you, and two game developers named Davey Wreden and William Pugh. It&#x2019;s at once a meditation on choice, freedom and authority, on what videogames are, and on the relationship between developer and player. And it&#x2019;s extremely funny. In fact, The Stanley Parable is one of the funniest videogames you can play, bearing the weight of its themes with absurdist lightness.</p><p>Stanley has started another day at work, pushing buttons on his keyboard as he always does&#x2014;only today is different. No one is in the office. So he goes to the meeting room to see if his colleagues are there; they are not. He goes up to his boss&#x2019; office and it&#x2019;s empty, too. But he manages to open a hidden door, which leads to him discovering the terrible secret behind his workplace. Stanley knows his purpose now, and destroys the facility that&#x2019;s been governing his life, allowing him to escape into the real world.</p><p>If you do what you&#x2019;re told in The Stanley Parable, you experience a story that you&#x2019;ve played hundreds of times before: you&#x2019;re on a hero&#x2019;s journey, the nobody who becomes the somebody, the star of a world generated just for you. On a planet of 7.5 billion other people, you get a fleeting sense of feeling special. But in The Stanley Parable, the credits don&#x2019;t roll when victory comes. The view returns to Stanley&#x2019;s dingy office and the Narrator, in his perfectly modulated, BBC-announcer voice, once again says, &#x201C;All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean?&#x201D;</p><p>So starts an eternal loop, a Garden Of Forking Paths, where you&#x2019;ll choose your own path through Stanley&#x2019;s winding office. Choose this corridor or that door; submit to or disobey directions; make this choice or that one, taking wildly different plotlines, each resulting in one of 19 possible endings. Whichever way you go, you&#x2019;ll always be accompanied by the Narrator.</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>Eventually he starts to fantasise that you, the player, has died and will be replaced by someone else.</p><figcaption><cite></cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>\n<p>Voiced by Kevan Brighting, the Narrator is the focal point of The Stanley Parable, a constant throughout the surreal, surprising, disturbing and confusing events that you&#x2019;ll set into action. Though Stanley&#x2019;s office feels distinctly American, the Narrator is resolutely British, commenting on all you do with the authoritative tone of a documentary voiceover. He lends gravitas to Stanley&#x2019;s mundane situation, a presence that you&#x2019;re initially inclined to obey, or at least to take seriously. But as you begin to defy him, he starts to become a character, turning from talking about Stanley in the thirdperson to addressing him directly, becoming by turns prideful, injured, sneering, domineering, wheedling, chummy, recriminating, angry, callous.</p><p>The Narrator is, after all, not only the antagonist of The Stanley Parable but also the architect of its nightmarish maze of choices. The different stories you follow are all his, and your decision to follow them or not will delight or enrage him. The Narrator and Stanley are inextricably tied together, each unable to exist without the other. Take the Z ending, where the Narrator is trying to get you to remain in a room filled with a starfield and light patterns. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you see that it&#x2019;s killing us, Stanley? I just... I want it to stop. I would&#x2014;we would both be so much happier if we just&#x2026; stopped,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;If we just stay right here, right in this moment, with this place&#x2026; Stanley, I think I feel&#x2026; happy. I actually feel happy.&quot;</p><p>But you can&#x2019;t stay there. Well, you technically can, but you&#x2019;re playing this game to be able to do something, and so you walk out, finding a series of stairs that lead up to a point you can throw yourself off. &#x201C;Oh, no! Stay away from those stairs! If you hurt yourself, if you die, the game will reset! We&#x2019;ll lose all of this!&#x201D; the Narrator exclaims. You&#x2019;ll survive the first fall, but presented with little else to do other than stand passively under the starfield, you&#x2019;ll try it again. &#x201C;My god, is this really how much you dislike my game?&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I just wanted us to get along, but I guess that was too much to ask.&#x201D; On the third attempt you finally die, and the game begins anew.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Narrator is many things, from motivator to exposition-dealer, but most of all, he&#x2019;s a representation of The Stanley Parable&#x2019;s developers&#x2014;or, at least, their relationship with players. His mood swings are an expression of the strain that lies between designers&#x2019; intentions and players&#x2019; free will, the way that narrative-driven games are designed around second-guessing the ways in which players will do the wrong thing or go the wrong way, whether intentionally or because they weren&#x2019;t paying attention. He frets when the player breaks sequence and sees areas he hasn&#x2019;t built, over plotting that doesn&#x2019;t make dramatic sense, and over the game itself: would it be more popular if it was Minecraft or Portal 2?</p><p>Sometimes the Narrator conflates Stanley and you, the player, talking to both at once. Near Stanley&#x2019;s office is a closed door with a sign reading &#x2018;Broom Closet&#x2019;. Almost every door is either closed or controlled by the game design, but if you should try it, this one will open. &#x201C;Stanley stepped into the broom closet, but there was nothing here, so he turned around and got back on track,&#x201D; says the Narrator. Stay in there, and he tries again: &#x201C;There was nothing here. No choice to make, no path to follow, just an empty broom closet. No reason to still be here.&#x201D; If you persist, the Narrator becomes increasingly frustrated and begins to mock the idea of you bragging to your friends about getting the &#x201C;broom closet ending&#x201D; and sneers at Stanley for only getting his job through family connections. Eventually he starts to fantasise that you, the player, has died and will be replaced by someone else who&#x2019;s filled in on &#x201C;the history of narrative tropes in videogaming&#x201D;.</p><p>Having the game respond so richly to your action (or, here, inaction), feels greatly rewarding. If you reenter the cupboard on another playthrough, the Narrator will resolve not to react, knowing it&#x2019;d only encourage you. And then, on the next playthrough, you&#x2019;ll see the door is boarded up so you can no longer get inside. The Stanley Parable knows how some of the greatest rewards in videogames come from noticing details you weren&#x2019;t pointed towards, like the scribblings on a whiteboard in a meeting room or the display on a monitor, and that there&#x2019;s magic in having a game respond when you do something you think wasn&#x2019;t expected. So when the Narrator spends some three minutes remarking on you standing in a cupboard you had the notion to enter, or reacts when you have the wild idea of trying to jump off a platform on to a gantry, it&#x2019;s like a spark has jumped between you and the game, a reward beyond an XP bar going up for doing what you were told.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s much quieter than the Narrator, but it&#x2019;s the level design that&#x2019;s making these moments really work, nudging your attention towards them while making them feel like secrets. Another dimension of The Stanley Parable&#x2019;s grand joke about videogames is that under all of its subversion it&#x2019;s very strictly controlled, funnelling you into rat runs that only let you move one way. Doors open and close at the level&#x2019;s whim and most of the choices you&#x2019;re presented with are binary, letting you go one way or the other and closing off the entrance after you go through. Its first moment of choice is a masterclass in spatial and narrative design. Beginning at Stanley&#x2019;s desk, you make a few turns through the bland and deserted office and reach a room with two open doors opposite its entrance.</p><p>&#x201C;When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left,&#x201D; says the Narrator, and you immediately begin to appreciate what this game might be. Go left and the Narrator continues his story, leaving you wondering what would&#x2019;ve happened had you gone right. Go right and he says, &#x201C;This was not the correct way to the meeting room, and Stanley knew it perfectly well. Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just to admire it.&#x201D; And we&#x2019;re complicit in the ruse, knowing the game&#x2019;s primed to respond to every choice we make.</p><p>&#x201C;The pacing of this opening section was important to get right&#x2014;this corridor has been moved and altered to make sure the player reaches the two doors in a good time,&#x201D; says a placard in a museum that lies down one of the game&#x2019;s routes. This place is a literal record of the game&#x2019;s development, exhibiting level plans, 3D assets and trailers in monumental white halls. It&#x2019;s a moment in which the circle between game, developer and player is fully completed, and then, once we&#x2019;ve toured all of its galleries, we&#x2019;re left with no other option than to allow ourselves to be swept back into the office and let the cycle move on.</p><p>The Stanley Parable rests on this tension: of how narrative-based videogames can&#x2019;t proceed without our input, and how they struggle to make this input meaningful. When you have too much choice, no decision has any particular value, and yet when your path is entirely preordained there&#x2019;s no real consequence to your involvement. Playing games is so often a contradiction: in picking up the controller we want to submerge ourselves in the world of a game designer, and yet we constantly wish to break free of the decisions they make for us. Like that of the Narrator and Stanley, it can be an abusive relationship, but in it can also lie the reason we play&#x2014;those sparks of connection where a game acknowledges our individual presence. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not your enemy, really, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201D; says the Narrator. &#x201C;I realise that investing your trust in someone else can be difficult. However, the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time.&#x201D;</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1554723640,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":221910},{"gid":"2417771014044992061","title":"Some video games that are like Bandersnatch, but better","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2417771014044992061","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Mat Jones)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/06/stories-untold-the-house-abandon.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/06/stories-untold-the-house-abandon.jpg/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" />\nIf you   ve choosed-and-adventured through Bandersnatch, the recent Black Mirror thing on Netflix, and aren   t already a fan of experimental interactive fiction: I envy you.

Path of Exile</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Steven Messner:</strong> Path of Exile has quietly become one of the best action RPGs around thanks to its almost incomprehensible depth and wildly different seasonal leagues, where whole new systems are introduced. But the best part is its character customisation and spell crafting system. Path of Exile encourages players to make marauders who let spell totems do all the killing for them, witches who melt hordes with a fiery beam, or duelists that cover every inch of the map in a deadly rain of arrows.</p>\n<h3>99. Twisted Insurrection</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>John Strike:</strong> Tiberian Sun&apos;s best mod brazenly shames the original Firestorm expansion in almost every way. It&#x2019;s bigger and bolder, offering new buildings, a whole fleet of new units and even a new faction. There&#x2019;s a completely new musical score and dozens of single player missions, some of which are based on the original Command &amp; Conquer. Not only are new missions and units still being added, but, as a standalone free download, it&apos;s the most accessible way to play one of C&amp;C&apos;s greats.</p>\n<h3>98. Killing Floor 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 81</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan Lahti: </strong>There are disturbingly few places in video games where I can cut an evil clown in half with a quad-barrelled shotgun. Killing Floor 2 is the world&#x2019;s greatest gore effects system laid atop an enjoyable skeleton. Hordes of monsters trickle into the map, magnetized to your position, and you mulch them with buzzsaw-spitters, incendiary shotguns, rocket launchers, or a microwave cannon that heats enemies from the inside until they burst. The dynamic slow-mo system adds so much, dampening the chaos just enough&#x2014;granting extra moments to take aim or take in the sight of an intestine flying across the screen. Tripwire is a skilled digital gunsmith, and the detail lent to particle effects and reload animations holds up wonderfully even under the scrutiny of these plentiful, slowed-down sequences. I also love that KF2 doesn&#x2019;t simply make these mutants into bullet sponges. On higher difficulties, enemies adopt different behavioral triggers that make them genuinely harder to handle.</p><p><strong>Wes Fenlon:</strong> The precision and teamwork it takes to play Killing Floor 2 at higher difficulties is especially thrilling. Also, I once played a community map that was monochrome purple and themed after Game Boy-era Pok&#xE9;mon. It was pretty bad, but I appreciated the option.</p>\n<h3>97. Night in the Woods</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil Savage:</strong> A coming-of-age platformer starring an anthropomorphic cat returning home to a dead-end town after dropping out of college. On paper, Night in the Woods sounds like it could be intolerable, but its relationships are so well developed&#x2014;so warm and fraught and human&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s impossible not to get drawn into Mae&apos;s world, and to want the best for her and her friends. I particularly love the frequent use of minigames as a way to highlight the need to escape the monotony of day-to-day responsibility.</p><p><strong>Andy Kelly: </strong>A beautiful, heartfelt story brought to life by flawed, nuanced characters who just happen to be talking animals. It says something about life, but always knows when to crack a joke&#x2014;and always with perfect timing&#x2014;when things get too heavy.</p>\n<h3>96. Deadly Premonition: The Director&apos;s Cut</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Philippa Warr: </strong>Deadly Premonition is always a gamble of a recommendation. It&apos;s a gamble worth taking, though, because if you get on with its strangeness and its idiosyncrasies, it rewards you with a weird and beautiful experience of a kind you don&apos;t often get in gaming. Yes, the cars handle horribly. Yes, the PC version has crashed on me extensively. Yes, it starts off more as an irritating pastiche of Twin Peaks. Yes, it has frustrating quicktime events. And yes, some reveals draw uncomfortably on lazy tropes. But within that is a supernatural-tinged mystery that alternates between survival horror third-person shooter and a horror comedy investigation. None of the game&apos;s shortcomings were dealbreakers for me and several of the characters I encountered as I hunted for the Raincoat Killer have stayed with me for the best part of a decade.</p><p><strong>Wes:</strong> The jank may be part of the charm, but at least make sure you install Durante&apos;s DPFix, which lets you select resolutions above 720p and fixes many minor graphical issues&#x2014;mitigating some of the PC port&#x2019;s shortcomings.</p>\n<h3>95. Stick Shift</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> Stick Shift is my go-to example of a game which invokes complex subject matter while also being really fun to play. As per developer Robert Yang&apos;s description: &quot;Stick Shift is an autoerotic night-driving game about pleasuring a gay car.&quot; It&apos;s part of a trilogy alongside Hurt Me Plenty and Succulent, and together they explore aspects of eroticism, consent, arousal, politics and more. It&apos;s also a game where you move your mouse rhythmically, working your car to a climax.</p>\n<h3>94. Elite Dangerous</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil:</strong> Frontier&apos;s galactic sandbox treads a fine line between excitement and tedium. Aliens! Dogfights! Smuggling! Interdictions! Ferrying pesticides to an outpost six lightyears away! However you decide to play, though&#x2014;whatever amount of excitement you desire&#x2014;Elite is still a masterfully crafted spaceship simulator. I love the design and feel of its ships, particularly the holographic UI and peerless sci-fi sound design. The thrill of warping to another solar system is never entirely diminished, meaning Elite remains entertaining even if you&#x2019;ve chosen the life of a glorified space trucker.</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>Whether it&apos;s a chunky cargo hauler or a nimble fighter, every starship in Elite has its own distinct personality. They&apos;re all a delight to fly. Even the most mundane task feels wonderfully tactile.</p>\n<h3>93. Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> While the original Ni no Kuni was co-designed by Spirited Away creator Studio Ghibli, it wasn&apos;t involved in this sequel. But developer Level-5 has done fine on its own, creating a rich fantasy world with a cast of vivid characters worthy of the Ghibli name. This is a sweeping JRPG about an usurped boy king on a quest to rebuild his kingdom and reclaim his throne. It&apos;s also one of the most colourful, vibrant games on PC.</p><p><strong>Wes:</strong> The cutscenes are remarkably Ghibli and full of pep and puns, but what really made me fall for Ni No Kuni 2 is just how many systems it layers atop systems, like a big-budget JRPG of old. The sprawling kingdom builder is the centerpiece, with characters to recruit and buildings to construct and upgrade.</p>\n<h3>92. Mu Cartographer</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> Mu Cartographer is initially obtuse. You&apos;ll probably feel utterly lost as to what you&#x2019;re supposed to do for a while. But once you start tinkering with all the different buttons and dials on the interface you begin to see how to explore the strange map. The peaks and troughs of digital noise on your display suddenly turn into recognisable shapes as you tweak the settings and find the sweet spot. Stepped pyramids rise up where seconds ago all you could see was a fuzzy mess.</p>\n<h3>91. Guild Wars 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 86</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil:</strong> Guild Wars 2 is full of clever quality-of-life features&#x2014;it&apos;s still one of the few MMOs that&apos;s figured out how to let you easily play with friends of a different level. The flow and pace of its maps are a thing of beauty, too. Groups expand and contract naturally, as people wander off to explore on their own, before coming together for a small-scale event or organising to complete a single map-wide objective. You get all the joy of cooperation without the need to commit a significant amount of your time. Just turn up and play. Then, when you eventually get tired, go off and do something else. There&apos;s also no subscription, and none of the expansions have raised the level cap, so you&apos;re free to come and go as you please, playing at your own pace without ever worrying that you&apos;re falling behind. You can play for hours every week if you want&#x2014;ticking off the hardest achievements and earning the rarest loot&#x2014;but I&apos;m happy to log back in every six months or so, safe in the knowledge that I&apos;m ready for whatever&apos;s next.</p><p><strong>Tom:</strong> I have fought huge dragon bosses and a marionette the size of a skyscraper, and I didn&apos;t need to grind for 200 hours for the privilege. Guild Wars 2 earnestly tries to reinvent the MMO by reshaping the bullshit grinding and levelling systems that had become rote in the genre.</p>\n<h3>90. Super Mega Baseball 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wes: </strong>I&apos;m about as bad at this surprisingly deep baseball game as I am at real baseball, but as a lapsed fan of America&apos;s pastime I appreciate how good this rendition is. It walks the line between a hyper-detailed sports sim and an arcadey NBA Jam-like, with simple controls but tons of nuance in pitching and hitting.</p><p><strong>Chris Livingston:</strong> The customization is great, letting you change everything from player abilities to team logos, and its Pennant Race mode makes every online game feel important.</p>\n<h3>89. The Stanley Parable</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel Roberts: </strong>You start in an abandoned office with a narrator telling you what you&apos;re supposed to do next. If you obey his instructions it will lead you to an ending. But if you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll discover many more fascinating, exciting little stories.</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>An antagonistic dialogue between a man with no body and another with no voice. Weird, funny and full of ideas.</p><p><strong>Pip:</strong> Games often struggle with comedy. The Stanley Parable manages to be consistently funny as well as whip smart.</p>\n<h3>88. Drawful 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p><br></p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Wes:</strong> A chill, surprisingly hilarious party game I can play for hours. Everyone joins in on a smartphone and gets a phrase to draw on the touchscreen, then writes their own descriptions of everyone else&apos;s drawing to trick the crowd or simply get the most laughs. It&apos;s like millennial Pictionary, so inevitably people draw a lot more dicks.</p>\n<h3>87. Nidhogg 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>James Davenport:</strong> The back-and-forth struggles of Nidhogg were already unpredictable, but bows, axes, swords, and daggers transform simple fencing standoffs into tense, sweaty battles for control. Nidhogg 2 is an excellent way to graft friends to the couch.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Evan: </strong>A see-sawing melee mess. No PC game produces more smile-yelling than Nidhogg 2.</p>\n<h3>86. Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll and I are on a break. I can&apos;t remember exactly why, but I know that I definitely rage-quit the sausage-grilling puzzler a while ago and haven&apos;t become sufficiently not angry to go back. That isn&apos;t a criticism, though; this is the puzzle game I recommend to the friends who want a real challenge.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> I managed one level.</p>\n<h3>85. Battletech</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<figure><p></p><figcaption><p><br></p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Evan:</strong> It&apos;s turn-based MMA with walking tanks. Unlike XCOM 2, the durability and modular design of mechs makes for drawn out, back-and-forth exchanges that become micro-stories of attrition and mettle. You trade blows with an Atlas, weave and evade it, it cleaves off one of your body segments, you circle around, knock it down and KO it with a face stomp. I love BattleTech&apos;s degrees of failure. You might complete all objectives but lose your rare, damage-boosted PPC, put a pilot in a two-month coma, or have to spend every nickel you just earned fixing up your battered Highlander. The campaign wrapped around BattleTech&apos;s granular combat is a bottomless well of procedurally generated missions with a heartwarming story of underdog regal revenge at its nucleus.</p>\n<h3>84. Football Manager 2018</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Joe Donnelly:</strong> Following some less comprehensive annual instalments, Football Manager 2018 gives us the most sophisticated soccer management simulation yet, where success is no longer determined by match performance alone. Piss off the wrong combination of players, and you&apos;ll risk a dressing room revolt. Suck up to the most popular, and you&apos;ll isolate your fringe stars. You need to balance influence and social standings to prevent the beautiful game from turning ugly.</p>\n<h3>83. Thumper</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 34</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>I don&apos;t think many people can consciously identify a &apos;fast-moving rhythm action space beetle combat game with a heady metal album aesthetic&apos; void in their lives. But it exists and Thumper can fix it.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> The dark, grungy synths and unusual time signatures create a fascinatingly ominous soundscape that draws you into the claustrophobic, reactive action. Thumper offers a mesmerising blend of palpable dread and empowering mastery&#x2014;at least it did for me until the later levels, which required a degree of dexterity I&apos;m not sure I possess.</p><p><strong>James: </strong>That scarab scrapes down the interdimensional highway at the centre of Thumper with so much speed and ferocity that the game almost literally breaks apart by the end. Nod your head to dull the pain.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>82. Euro Truck Simulator 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 89</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> The problem with simulators is that they&apos;re often badly designed, technically janky or both. But Euro Truck Simulator 2 is neither of these things. This is a deep, polished, and immensely playable driving game set in a vast, mostly accurate replica of Europe. You can drive seamlessly between countries, and there&apos;s an understated beauty to the scenery that passes you by. It&apos;s also incredibly atmospheric, especially at night or in the rain. There&apos;s no better game to play while listening to music or catching up on podcasts, and it&apos;s deeply customisable too, meaning you can make each road trip as realistic or accessible as you like, depending on how deep you want the simulation to be.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> In many ways I prefer American Truck Simulator. That&apos;s not because I love weigh stations&#x2014;they&apos;re fine, if that&apos;s your thing&#x2014;but because America&apos;s vast, terrifying emptiness feels more isolated, more epic, and, dare I say, more romantic. Euro Truck Simulator 2, on the other hand, is dense and busy, but also muted&#x2014;it&apos;s altogether greyer and more moodily atmospheric. Both games are fantastic, and which one you prefer is likely a matter of which style of road trip speaks more to your personality. How many simulation games can you say that of?</p>\n<h3>81. FTL: Faster Than Light&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 21</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel:</strong> It turns out being the captain of your own spaceship is stressful as hell, but you&apos;ll take part in some great stories along the way. FTL is a superior mix of roguelike and strategy. While Into The Breach is taking its place in my life, this is still one of the best space-set games around.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Wes: </strong>It can make for a great party game, too. Put someone in the driver&apos;s seat and let the crowd make choices. Suddenly half your ship is on fire and you&apos;ve accidentally vented one of your crew into space.</p>\n<h3>80. Stalker: Call of Pripyat</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 41</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong> This grim and unforgiving open world FPS never turns you into an invincible superhero. No matter how much gear and weaponry you scrounge from the irradiated exclusion zone, you&apos;re still mortal and fragile, alone in a terrifying world of mutants, monsters, and roaming factions of AI-controlled humans. This lends Stalker an unending tension and fills every encounter with dread. From start to finish, there&apos;s a sense that at any moment you could meet your unceremonious end.</p>\n<h3>79. Doom 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 1994 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 76</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wes:</strong> People are making mods and maps for this game like it was released a year ago. That&apos;s awesome. But what really strikes me about Doom 2 is how fun it still is, and how different it feels from decades more advanced shooters. There&apos;s a purity in how it moves, how it sounds and the minimum frames of animation it takes to sell firing the super shotgun.</p>\n<h3>78. Grim Fandango Remastered</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 96</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>Twenty years after its initial release it&apos;s still a real pleasure to revisit the film noir world of Manny Calavera, travel agent of the afterlife. Nowadays I play purely for the story so I keep online hints at hand for when progress stalls.</p><p><strong>Tom Senior: </strong>Shout out here to Glottis, the giant orange demon who&apos;s too big and happy to quite fit into the world he&#x2019;s in.</p>\n<h3>77. Warhammer: Vermintide 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel:</strong> There&apos;s a long tail to Vermintide 2 if you&apos;re willing to stick with this four-player Left 4 Dead-alike set in the Warhammer universe. It looks prettier than the first game, offers more in-depth character progression, and has much better combat.</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>It feels really good to stab up a rat, and if that&apos;s not worth a spot on this list, I&apos;d love to know what is.</p>\n<h3>76. Oxenfree</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel: </strong>This spooky adventure game has a group of young friends inadvertently unlock a supernatural force on a haunted island. The relationships and various tensions between all the characters feel very real, and the dialogue is funny and poignant. These characters feel like they could&apos;ve been people I went to school with.</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>The snappy, fun dialogue makes Oxenfree feel more theatrical than realistic, but that fits perfectly with the eerie mystery and interpersonal drama.</p>\n<h3>75. Regency Solitaire</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> I added Grey Alien&apos;s card-game-slash-Regency-romance to our Top 100 discussion list, then reinstalled the game and spent three hours of the Top 100 discussion playing this in the background. I&apos;m fighting the urge to play it again now instead of finishing this incredibly short paragraph about why it&apos;s good. The solitaire aspect is really strong, it&apos;s super easy to play just one more round, and the story is light but charming. Are we done? Can I boot it up again?</p>\n<h3>74. Metro: Last Light Redux</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 95</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Not many shooters have you frantically pumping up a pneumatic gun before you can fire it, but that&#x2019;s Metro for you. These ramshackle weapons carry you through a filthy, atmospheric corridor shooter set in the depths of the Moscow undercity. The tunnels hide mutant creatures and nests of horrible spidery things, but the most dangerous enemies are the human clans trying to scrape out a living in the post-apocalypse.</p><p><strong>Samuel: </strong>A beautiful and grim FPS that&apos;s refreshingly bleak for a modern triple-A game. The world building in Metro: Last Light is dazzling to me&#x2014;the little snapshots of human civilisation that show how there are children in these underground settlements who never knew the world before it got into this bleak, decrepit state. And the story features some unforgettable moments, such as an early flashback that shows&#x2014;from the perspective of the pilots&#x2014;how a passenger plane was destroyed in the nuclear blast. It&apos;s a chilling world that&apos;s hard work just to exist in, but I love that it&apos;s a post-apocalyptic setting that doesn&#x2019;t succumb to the desire to over-stylise anything. It commits to showing the horrors of what a nuclear war would do to the modern world, and I&apos;d recommend it to absolutely anyone.</p>\n<h3>73. Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 40</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Steven: </strong>Square Enix&apos;s from-the-ashes MMO enjoyed another stellar year following the release of Stormblood, a revolution-themed expansion that whisks players across the sea to Eastern-inspired worlds that add much richness to an already great story. Though its endgame has become a predictable grind at this point, Final Fantasy 14 is still able to keep things exciting thanks to the steady pace of new bosses, dungeons, and raids to clear. Each one is just as memorable as the last thanks to a stunning soundtrack and beautiful world design.</p>\n<h3>72. The Norwood Suite&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>Cosmo D&apos;s first-person jazz hotel exploration has you poking around a converted mansion and uncovering the secrets of its former owner, celebrated pianist, Peter Norwood. Musicality shapes the whole experience, warping the space and affecting the denizens. As you dig around you&apos;ll also discover the game&apos;s sense of humour via visual gags and surreal chats with guests and visitors. For a related experience you should also check out the developer&#x2019;s free game, Off-Peak.</p>\n<h3>71. Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is what we so often clamour for: an RPG where you&apos;re not an intergalactic savior or chosen one, but just some dude leading a small army on a sprawling, simulated map filled with other dudes leading other armies. It&apos;s sandbox in the truest sense, and the feeling of loosing an arrow into a line of galloping cavalry still holds up.</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>You start with nothing: left for dead in a town with few weapons, no supplies and barely any gold. From such inauspicious beginnings, you&apos;re free to do just about anything. Hunt bandits, befriend lords, rob pretty much anyone. Or, if you don&apos;t fancy leading hundreds of soldiers, just go fight for prestige in the arena. We&apos;ve been waiting years for Mount &amp; Blade 2, but Warband still has much to offer.</p>\n<h3>70. StarCraft 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Across its three campaigns, StarCraft 2 boasts some of the best, most cinematic single-player RTS missions on PC. New challenges are constantly being thrown at you, forcing you to try new units and tactics, and the story isn&apos;t bad either. When you&apos;re done with all that, you can take your newfound skills online, which still has a huge and dedicated following. There&apos;s a bottomless pit of tips, tutorials, and strategies online, meaning new players have a decent chance of catching up.</p>\n<h3>69. Galactic Civilizations 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2011 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>Maybe a game like Stellaris will knock this classic spacebound 4X strategy game out of the Top 100, but not this year. It&apos;s hard to beat a game that&apos;s so smart and complete, and that can generate so much strategic intrigue with every campaign. The AI is so cunning that former PC Gamer staffer-turned-developer Tom Francis once wrote an entire book about one of his attempts to thwart it. Singleplayer games don&apos;t get much deeper than this.</p>\n<h3>68. Prison Architect</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong> There&apos;s an engrossing amount of depth to the management simulation of Prison Architect, where building a workshop for inmates to make license plates doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ll just walk in and begin working. First they&apos;ll need training, which requires classrooms, which require instructors, who require work and class schedules and their own facilities. Oh, and metal detectors to make sure the inmates don&apos;t smuggle out tools to use as weapons against guards or other inmates, or to tunnel under the walls of your prison. It&apos;s not easy building and managing a small city where most of the population is plotting escape.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> I love it when things go to shit in management sims, and Prison Architect is enormously fun to watch (and manage) when disaster inevitably strikes. A streak of black comedy runs through the game, and there&apos;s something darkly hilarious about a riot erupting&#x2014;these cartoonish little characters shivving each other, starting fires and beating up guards. Something as simple as a fight in the canteen can be the flashpoint for a full-scale riot, and trying to suppress it safely and quickly is a real test of skill. But that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t have some fun observing the chaos before rolling your sleeves up and stepping in to deal with it.</p>\n<h3>67. Ori and the Blind Forest</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 62</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> An adorable Ghibli-esque aesthetic&#x2014;particularly the opening cutscene&#x2014;gives way to a rock hard Metroidvania platformer. Your eyes are as likely to tear up with emotion as they are with absolute fury if you fail a boss one too many times.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Tom: </strong>It looks like sugar but tastes like salt. Ori is not the moonlit animal paradise it appears to be at first glance. It&#x2019;s a game about loss, revenge, and bastard-hard jumping challenges. The art is absolutely gorgeous. It&apos;s a hazy, dreamlike world of artfully twisted overgrowth and spike pits. The movement is so quick, precise and responsive I just want to squeeze it, even as it stabs me repeatedly in the heart. Approach with caution and keep some hankies and a swear jar within reach.</p>\n<h3>66. Frostpunk</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong> A survival and crisis management sim about building and sustaining city in a frozen world. In addition to providing food, warmth, and shelter to your citizens, you have to provide them something much trickier: hope for the future. That&apos;s immensely difficult when people are starving, freezing, and working themselves to death under your direction, and the choices you face are grim ones that never leave you feeling like a hero, even when things work out. Frostpunk is a game that asks two questions: &apos;How far are you willing to go to save lives?&apos; And, &apos;No, really, how far are you willing to go?&apos; It&apos;s a masterful exploration of the burden of leadership, the true costs of survival, and the balancing act between guiding your citizens and controlling them.</p>\n<h3>65. Diablo 3</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 30</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> &apos;Maybe I should start another Crusader run&apos;: seven words that could take up 60 hours of my life. Diablo 3 is still a stellar action RPG that has only become more generous year on year after its unsteady and controversial launch. The necromancer is a fantastic addition that calls back to Diablo 2 without nostalgically retreading the same ground. If you want to smash up thousands of monsters for gold and loot, there aren&apos;t many games that do it as well as Diablo 3.</p>\n<h3>64. Bayonetta</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 32</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel:</strong> A superb hack-and-slash game that rewards mastery with feeling like a badass. It&apos;s pretty much the first place I&apos;d send anyone new to this genre of game that has its modern roots in Capcom&apos;s Devil May Cry series. This, from that game&apos;s creator, is funny, stylish and satisfying to learn. Its sequel, which Nintendo published, doesn&apos;t come close to matching the original. The range of weapons here fits together perfectly.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> The fast-paced combat is yet to be bettered, and the world and story are equal parts stylish and absurd.</p>\n<h3>63. Crypt of the Necrodancer</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>The rhythm combat in this game is so polished that I love it even when it&apos;s at its most stressful. You have to move on every beat or risk losing your cash multiplier, which means there&apos;s no downtime to plan your next move. Is a multiplier all that important, you ask? &quot;Oh,&quot; I reply, &quot;Only if you want to keep being able to afford new items at the shop where the amazingly catchy soundtrack is suddenly given an EVEN MORE AMAZING operatic flavour thanks to a singing shopkeeper called Freddie Merchantry.&quot;</p><p><strong>Wes:</strong> This would be a great roguelike in its own right, but it&apos;s almost unfair how cleverly the musical element is threaded through exploration and combat. Try dungeon dancing to your own music for a new challenge.</p>\n<h3>62. Sunless Sea</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 75</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> I bounced off Sunless Sea so hard when it first came out&#x2014;I remember clunky combat and irritating resource grind as core objections. Returning to the game with the Zubmariner DLC I found myself well and truly suckered in&#x2014;devoting hours to pottering away in the Unterzee, drinking in Failbetter&apos;s expert prose and luxuriating in the art style. Sunless Skies is shaping up to be another step forward so I&apos;m singing Sunless Sea&apos;s praises now, lest seas be eclipsed by skies in the near future!</p>\n<h3>61. Baldur&apos;s Gate 2: Enhanced Edition</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 48</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 is still a magnificent achievement. Few RPGs since have been as broad, deep or fully featured as this sprawling classic. Pillars of Eternity and other games are steadily bringing the classic RPG back to prominence, but Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 is still very much worth playing today, and is still one of the most faithful videogame interpretations of D&amp;D&apos;s Forgotten Realms setting. It&apos;s a great party RPG too. Few modern games would be brave enough to implement a morality system that causes party members to fall out with you and leave the party&#x2014;the closest you might get is Wrex&apos;s rebellion in Mass Effect. While we all remember Minsc and his space hamster companion Boo, the roster went much deeper and accurately reflected the spread of D&amp;D classes, from lawful good paladins to chaotic neutral thieves.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> After the slightly too long tutorial dungeon, Baldur&apos;s Gate II hits the ground running, setting you loose in the massive city of Athkatla to earn money to fund the next leg of your journey. It&#x2019;s a great way to encourage you to explore the city, seeking out its stories and adventures.</p>\n<h3>60. Fez</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 67</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil: </strong>A vast, beautiful mystery that&apos;s equal parts intriguing and relaxing, Fez is a puzzle-platformer that forgoes enemies and peril, instead offering a pleasant adventure about a strange world full of questions to answer. At its most basic, you rotate between four 2D planes, shifting the world in order to create a path to the next door. But over the course of the game, you&apos;ll solve riddles, uncover secrets, and even decode languages. Fez is a tantalising puzzle box just waiting to be unlocked.</p>\n<h3>59. 80 Days</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 37</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel: </strong>Take a journey around a steampunk-infused world as Passepartout, Phileas Fogg&apos;s indispensable assistant. Then, whether you succeed or fail, take the journey again and again, and see all the places and stories you missed the first time around. 80 Days is almost entirely dependent on great writing and little bits of art, and it&apos;s enough to bring the entire world to life. While it feels made for mobile, you should definitely pick it up on desktop if you&apos;ve never played it.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>58. Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> This feels like the most PC-friendly Final Fantasy to me. Like the rest of the games in the series, it&apos;s a beautiful big RPG with a cast of characters that span from annoying (Vaan) to awesome (Balthier). This entry is the only one with the excellent gambit tactics system, which lets you program your party&apos;s AI to blitz dungeons and bosses with satisfying efficiency.</p><p><strong>Samuel: </strong>You can fast-forward this version of the game, too, giving the combat the pace and catharsis it desperately needed back when it came out on PS2.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>57. Hexcells Infinite</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>This is the third game in Matthew Brown&apos;s hex-grid logic puzzler series, and it&apos;s the best of the bunch. The &apos;infinite&apos; part of the title refers to the fact that it can generate infinite puzzles if you want to keep playing. But the real joy, and the reason I keep replaying it, is the set which Brown has hand-crafted. Absolute puzzle bliss.</p>\n<h3>56. Homeworld Remastered Collection</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> The saddest spaceships in games must travel the galaxy looking for a new home in Relic&apos;s classic RTS. If you love brain-scrambling 3D battles then this is the only strategy game that really delivers. Deserts of Kharak is excellent too, but I&apos;d sooner play a game bold enough to deploy Adagio for Strings in a scrap.</p>\n<h3>55. Dota 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 54</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> I have spent north of 2,000 hours in this game. You do not need to know how much money I have spent in this game. But that investment, both temporal and financial, was because this MOBA continued to reward me. There&apos;s a rich esports scene, a daft and creative community, the ability for friendships to blossom and for groups of players to cross pollinate as friends of friends move in and out of your teammate invite list. I only stop by occasionally now, but Valve continues to offer interesting updates. Turbo mode is my favourite addition in recent times, not least because it affords newbies a space where they can try characters out without as much pressure as a normal match.</p>\n<h3>54. PlayerUnknown&apos;s Battlegrounds</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 25</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel: </strong>It&apos;s a phenomenon I&apos;d recommend trying to anyone who plays on PC, even if they bounce off it. That tension of landing in this world and seeing what plays out is an experience everyone should have. Evan put it best last year, so allow me to repeat it here: &quot;it compresses the time and space that survival games like DayZ give you, forcing you into contact with other players and out of your comfort zone.&quot;</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> I play PlayerUnknown&apos;s Battlegrounds as a stealth game, moving carefully between cover, keeping out of sight, biding my time. But the thrill here is that the &apos;guards&apos; are real people, which makes sneaking under their noses even more exhilarating.</p>\n<h3>53. Deus Ex</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2000 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 23</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> This one has slipped down the list this year, largely because in recent times we&apos;ve seen developers pick up the immersive sim baton and run with it&#x2014;see entry number two in this list for the results. Deus Ex is still a classic, though. Even though the visuals, UI, dialogue and sound design seem more creaky each year, the scope for experimentation and emergent player-authored action is still impressive.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>It&apos;s creaky for sure, but Deus Ex&apos;s freedom still feels remarkable, as does its level of respect for the player. Most games feel compelled to clearly flag when you&#x2019;re about to make a narrative choice that might have a consequence. But Deus Ex thrusts you into a paranoid world where everyone has an agenda and every command should be questioned.</p>\n<h3>52. Fallout 4</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel:</strong> I&apos;d recommend all of the modern Fallout games to someone who&#x2019;s never played them for various reasons, and this, in essence, represents that entire era of the series on our list (we were very close to including the original Fallout, too, but ultimately stuck with our one per series rule). New Vegas is the best for reactive storytelling, Fallout 3 has my favourite side quests, and Fallout 4 feels the most refined when it comes to combat, presentation and world design. Even if the choices towards the end didn&apos;t produce outcomes I was happy with, I loved journeying around that world with Nick Valentine and Piper. And taking on the role of pulp-style hero The Silver Shroud represents my favourite superhero experience in any game.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Evan: </strong>There&apos;s nothing quite like Fallout&apos;s setting. Its cynical, post-apocalyptic, Atomic Age sci-fi is dripping with black humour and absurdity. I&apos;m grateful that something so esoteric continues to get the big-budget treatment.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> We&apos;re big fans of immersive sims at PC Gamer, and yet I love Bethesda&apos;s RPGs for being practically the opposite. Fallout 4 lets you be a silent stealth killer who wears a giant suit of power armour&#x2014;not because it makes sense within the world, but because it makes sense within the underlying systems. It&apos;s an anti-immersive sim, offering satisfying freedom in how you build your wasteland wanderer. &#xA0;</p>\n<h3>51. Stardew Valley</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 22</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> A miserable office worker inherits a farm and starts a new life in the idyllic Stardew Valley. This Harvest Moon-inspired farming sim is pleasantly freeform and lets you live the way you want to, whether that&apos;s just lazily growing a few crops here and there, or starting a ruthlessly efficient mayonnaise empire.</p><p><strong>Bo:</strong> Stardew Valley is everything I ever wanted out of Harvest Moon, but unchained from Nintendo&apos;s puritanical approach to content.</p>\n<h3>50. EVE Online</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2003 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 44</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>It&apos;s obtuse, and it takes a lot of time and effort to become properly mixed up in the corporations that drive EVE Online&apos;s greatest dramas, but I have taken a lot of pleasure in hopping into a vessel and mining for a few hours, quietly turning in a small profit and enjoying the vibe of EVE&apos;s cosmos. It looks beautiful stretched across two monitors, and if I do find myself yearning for the grand stories of war and betrayal, I can always read about them later in PC Gamer.</p>\n<h3>49. BioShock</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2007 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 17</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel:</strong> While as a shooter it&apos;s far from best-in-class these days, exploring the different parts of this underwater world and learning its story is an experience no other game has matched for me.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> Rapture is still one of the most atmospheric settings on PC, letting you explore a bizarre, broken society in a state of fascinating decay.</p>\n<h3>48. Warframe</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Steven:</strong> Digital Extremes&apos; cooperative loot shooter quietly became one of the best free-to-play games and people are only just now catching on. In the years since its rocky release, Warframe has grown into a deeply satisfying and complex online game with thousands of hours worth of quests to complete and gear to farm.</p>\n<h3>47. Darkest Dungeon</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 83</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Even as DLC has made it a bigger experience, I continue to value Darkest Dungeon&apos;s focus. It&apos;s an intimidating game for all the right reasons: difficulty, uncertainty, risk and reward. The audio and combat camera effects deserve an award for how they make fights between illustrated paper characters feel like Eldritch kung fu.</p>\n<h3>46. Opus Magnum</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Solving an Opus Magnum puzzle isn&apos;t satisfying the first time. You build an alchemy machine with tracks, rotating arms and flowchart instructions&#x2014;producing gold from lead, for instance. Your sloppy contraption may look beautiful in motion, but how could you move on to the next challenge when your friend solved the same problem more elegantly? That quest for perfection is deviously engrossing. Few puzzle games feel so good to finally master.</p>\n<h3>45. Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 60</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy: </strong>The Enhanced Edition of Torment is currently the best way to play this supremely weird RPG on modern PCs. You play as an immortal being with amnesia, trying to piece his past together. The writing is the star here, bringing Dungeons &amp; Dragons&apos; Planescape setting to life in exquisite, wordy detail. Think of any RPG convention and Torment will subvert or twist it in some fascinating way, and the characters who join your party along the way are truly strange.</p>\n<h3>44. Civilization 5</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tyler: </strong>I vacillate between them, but even though I like Civ 6&apos;s city districts, Civilization 5 with all the expansions is still the evening destroyer I&apos;d recommend. I wish the series would reexamine its assumptions about the world and make more radical changes in the future, but for now, Civ 5 is still the standard bearer for turn-based empire building: complex enough not to become too rote, but accessible enough for just about anyone who enjoys rewriting history.</p><p><strong>Evan:</strong> I prefer Civ 6&#x2014;it&apos;s shallow, but I need my 1440p boardgames to look as pretty as possible, and the expressive, animated leaders of Civ 6 add a lot. But the fact that there&apos;s still a debate between the two is an endorsement of Firaxis&apos; approach to putting meaningful new spins on one of PC gaming&apos;s longest-standing, most celebrated genres.</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>In all the time I&apos;ve played Civ 5, I&apos;ve never actually won a game. And so it&apos;s a testament to just how compelling and accessible its strategy is that I keep coming back, trying new tactics and shaping my civilisation in new and interesting ways. It&apos;s the journey&#x2014;taking my people from humble beginnings to advanced empires&#x2014;that I really enjoy. The destination ultimately isn&apos;t that important.</p>\n<h3>43. Invisible, Inc.</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 50</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>This turn-based tactics game has you controlling a squad of superspies in missions to knock out guards and steal data before the alarms detect you. I love Klei&apos;s angular art, and it&apos;s miraculous that the team were able to build such a tight and nuanced tactics game with procedurally generated offices. As with Into the Breach, Invisible, Inc. gives you tons of information about what&apos;s going on with enemies. You can see their sight lines clearly and judge their intentions. Your main decisions come down to your use of power points to hack systems. You can disable alarms or unlock doors to access tantalisingly placed upgrade terminals. Do you grab your objective and flee before security arrives, or take a gamble for an upgrade that might make future missions a lot easier?</p>\n<h3>42. Overcooked</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 77</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Pure co-op calamity with a deceptively cheerful art style. You will never yell &quot;I need lettuce!&quot; with more anger and urgency.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Samuel:</strong> So enjoyable to pick up, then appallingly difficult to master as you chase those three star ratings. If only I could take it less seriously&#x2014;me and my partner had to stop playing because I was treating it like a part-time kitchen job. &quot;Plates, plates, PLATES!&quot;</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>It&apos;s like if the TV show Hell&apos;s Kitchen was a game&#x2014;swearing and all.</p>\n<h3>41. Super Hexagon</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Jody Macgregor: </strong>Terry Cavanagh of VVVVVV fame&apos;s twitchiest game, Super Hexagon makes you a triangle trapped in pulsing, multicoloured hexagons, dodging through gaps in spinning walls at high speed. It&apos;s the definition of easy to learn and bloody impossible to master. I used to think hexagons were fine. Perfectly respectable shapes. Maybe not as fun as parallelograms, which are basically drunk rectangles, but pretty good overall. Now I&apos;ve played Super Hexagon I hate them. They give me a rash. Terrible shapes. To hell with hexagons.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> Before writing this paragraph I fired up Super Hexagon for the first time in five years, and after only a few tries I was already pushing up near my best times. This is the kind of game that sears itself into your subconscious; burrowing deep down into your muscle memory just waiting for you to return. As a shortform arcade game it&apos;s practically perfect&#x2014;a pulsating, rotating, constantly shifting assault of shapes and sounds with an instant restart that has you back in the action before the voiceover can finish saying &quot;game over&quot;.</p>\n<h3>40. Mass Effect 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2010 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 7</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel: </strong>The facial animations really date BioWare games, but Mass Effect 2 is still the best at showing darker, more interesting sides to its dense sci-fi universe. Plus it still has my favourite party of characters from a modern BioWare RPG. Maybe it&apos;s time for another trilogy replay.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> The greatest ensemble cast in RPG history. The idea of recruiting the galaxy&apos;s most notorious warriors and criminals is a brilliant excuse to gather up a motley crew of weird, flawed, interesting people, and I cared about all of them.</p>\n<h3>39. Hearthstone</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 45</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tim: </strong>Hearthstone is in a funny spot. It&apos;s as gigantic as it&apos;s ever been, but with the departure of game director Ben Brode and the looming threat of Valve&apos;s Artifact, now would be a good time for Blizzard&#x2019;s CCG to shake things up a little. The arrival of a tournament mode later this year may do that, but despite an atypically diverse meta, I&apos;ve felt my desire to grind the ladder wane. Regardless, for now Hearthstone remains peerless in terms of the quality and polish of the experience.</p>\n<h3>38. Grand Theft Auto 5</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 12</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> GTA 5 is one of the most lavish singleplayer experiences you can have on PC, with impeccable production values, superb mission variety, and a wonderfully vibrant city. It&apos;s massive, but I&apos;ve finished it three times&#x2014;that&apos;s how much I love being in Los Santos. For me, Michael is Rockstar&apos;s best protagonist: a weary, slightly pathetic crook past his prime trying to make it in a world that&#x2019;s left him behind.</p><p><strong>Samuel: </strong>I change my mind about GTA Online every few months, but the fidelity of the world is unbeaten. I adore the original heists, and I&apos;ve had a lot of fun playing the game with other people. I&apos;ve seen those streets so many times now, though, and am desperate to play whatever comes next in the series. Or, you know, they could bring Red Dead to PC.</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>Whatever you think about GTA Online (relationship status: it&apos;s complicated), that first set of multiplayer heists are among the best co-op experiences you can have on PC. The way they divide your team of four into smaller groups, each performing a specific task that slowly draws everyone together for a single, action packed finale is&#x2014;when you successfully pull it off&#x2014;tense, exciting and memorable.</p><p><strong>Joe: </strong>GTA Online is a shop window, and few games let you observe other players&apos; wares with such impact. Seeing that new car, aircraft or chopper hurtling towards you makes you want it&#x2014;which makes grinding to get it less of a chore.</p>\n<h3>37. Company of Heroes&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2006 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 56</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> It&apos;s Relic&apos;s best game and frankly still one of the best real-time strategy games ever made. Jumping into a skirmish against the AI, it holds up today as well as it did at launch, which is a testament to the quality of the art and sound direction, and the success of Relic&apos;s squad-based take on unit control. The expansions are decent, but I still relish the purity of Company of Heroes&apos; asymmetrical core matchup. The US has a slight numbers advantage in the early infantry stages of a battle but the Axis forces can bring halftracks to the mid-game and elite tanks into the endgame. A few games have tried to imitate Company of Heroes over the years, but none have really come close.</p>\n<h3>36. Half-Life 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2004 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 11</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Gordon Freeman awakes from stasis to find Earth transformed into a dystopian hellscape by an invading alien force. Valve&apos;s influential FPS is still fantastic, particularly its eerie, understated atmosphere. The Combine are genuinely unnerving antagonists, but they didn&apos;t anticipate going up against a mute physicist who can yank radiators off the wall and launch them at high speeds.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A linear FPS but one that makes you feel as if you&apos;re finding your own path through it, rather than being shoved along rails by the developers. And the gravity gun is still the most enjoyable multitool in games: perfect for solving physics puzzles, playing catch with Dog, using a metal door as a shield, or flinging a toilet into a Metrocop&apos;s head.</p>\n<h3>35. Devil Daggers</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Jody: </strong>FPS design often copies the Halo idea of a single, repeatable loop of fun, but Devil Daggers really boils it down. Here the loop is backpedalling in an arc while shooting daggers at nearby enemies, clearing enough room to aim at the weak spot of a distant, tougher enemy, then spinning around to take out the skull-face jerk sneaking up behind you. It&apos;s just you and infinite bastards to shoot. Perfect.</p><p><strong>Evan:</strong> If you die and don&apos;t go to heaven or hell, you play Devil Daggers until you win.</p>\n<h3>34. Forza Horizon 3</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 29</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil:</strong> A gloriously silly arcade playground that takes the Forza Motorsport series&apos; deep love of cars and customisation and transports it into a vibrant, luscious world full of ridiculous races and entertaining off-road mayhem. Forza Horizon 3&apos;s best feature is the skill chain system, which transforms an otherwise basic drive between events into a challenge to string together stunts without crashing.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> Driving pretend cars doesn&apos;t get any better than the Forza series, and Horizon brilliantly softens the simulation while still maintaining a feeling of weight and realism.</p><p><strong>Evan:</strong> All racers should be set in Australia.</p>\n<h3>33. The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2011 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 26</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Skyrim remains one of the most evocative settings on PC. It&apos;s not as big as some game worlds, but the varied biomes&#x2014;from the bubbling hot springs of Eastmarch to the snow-battered coastline of Winterhold&#x2014;make it feel much bigger than it is. The role-playing is shallow and the writing isn&apos;t great, but the sense of place and feeling of freedom make up for it. Picking a direction, going for a wander, and seeing what you&apos;ll find out there among the snow and ice is The Elder Scrolls at its most captivating.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>You can finish (or completely ignore) the main story and still have a couple hundred hours of self-guided fun&#x2014;especially by adding mods to the mix. Skyrim gives you a special kind of freedom seen in few RPGs.</p>\n<h3>32. Proteus</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> If this was Pip&apos;s Top 100 Proteus would be in the number one spot. It&apos;s a contemplative experience where you wander a procedurally generated island, delighting in what you find. I often find myself drifting back to it in moments of stress, treating myself to a short digital holiday. One time I forgot I&apos;d tweaked the game files and accidentally turned everything red, so that was a surprise. Seas of blood. But if you don&#x2019;t make seas of blood it&apos;s gloriously restful!</p>\n<h3>31. Crusader Kings 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 52</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil: </strong>Crusader Kings 2 isn&apos;t just a grand strategy about medieval kingdoms. It&apos;s a grand strategy about the people in charge of those kingdoms. You&apos;re not the abstract concept of the country of France; you&apos;re the King of France, a 60-year-old man who, after a protracted battle against the rebellious Duke of Burgundy, is now on his deathbed, about to leave the fate of his dynasty to an idiot son. You&apos;re not the ever-expanding territory of the Holy Roman Empire; you&apos;re an increasingly deranged emperor who people think has been possessed by the devil. By generating stories about people, Crusader Kings II is an endlessly fascinating soap opera that&apos;s different every time. In my last campaign, I didn&apos;t even play. I used the command console to simply observe the action, watching as an epic period drama played out across the map.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> What&apos;s most interesting is how your relationships change when you die and continue playing as your heir. Those three children you had don&apos;t seem so wonderful once you&apos;ve assumed the role of the eldest. The other two, while devoted to their father, now hate you and may plot against you. Your entire view of the world changes regularly, not just because the players change but because you yourself do, by dying and playing as someone new.</p>\n<h3>30. Portal 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2011 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 5</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong> It should have been impossible to top the near-perfect Portal in comedy, storytelling, and physics-bending first-person puzzles, but Portal 2 somehow manages it, and even throws in some fantastic multiplayer on top.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>Portal 2 brings a funny and sometimes disarmingly poignant story to its mind-bending puzzles, and the results are exceptional. Your journey through the various eras of Aperture Science make the game a constant delight.</p>\n<h3>29. World of Warcraft</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2004 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 59</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Blizzard&apos;s long-running MMORPG simply refuses to die, and in fact seems to be getting better with every expansion. The most recent, 2016&apos;s Legion, brought in a swathe of quality-of-life improvements and some of the best questing in World of Warcraft&apos;s nearly 14-year history, making it worth playing all over again. It&apos;s still pretty grindy, especially compared to the more streamlined Guild Wars 2, but there are few online worlds this rich and storied to spend time in.</p><p><em>Don&apos;t miss Steven&apos;s </em><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-review/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Battle For Azeroth review</em></a><em> for some more recent WoW words.</em></p>\n<h3>28. Undertale</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 61</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Undertale subverts RPG cliches with constant self-reference, but unlike many &apos;parody games&apos;, it&apos;s not cynical or derivative. It plays on expectations without succumbing to them, with characters we&#x2019;d love even without the metacommentary on game design, fandom, and authorship. Undertale is a great RPG even if you don&apos;t get every reference.</p>\n<h3>27. Fortnite Battle Royale</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>James: </strong>Fortnite&apos;s battle royale mode started as a weak PUBG imitation, but an unprecedented update cycle has made it not just the best battle royale game, but one of the most fascinating games in development today. With map changes, new items, and one-off world events almost every week, Fortnite is endlessly entertaining to live in.</p>\n<h3>26. League of Legends</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2009 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wes: </strong>Regular changes to the meta have kept League alive and on top for years. It&#x2019;s still the best entry point for the MOBA genre.</p><p><strong>Pip: </strong>I favour ARAM&#x2014;a five-vs-five battle where randomly assigned characters let spells and punches fly across a single lane. I visit the pressure of the three lane Summoner&#x2019;s Rift from a safe distance&#x2014;as an esports spectator.</p>\n<h3>25. Cities: Skylines</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 82</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy: </strong>While the most recent SimCity did everything it could to stifle creativity, Cities: Skylines gave players the power to make anything they want&#x2014;in part thanks to the deep mod support. The result is the best city-builder around.</p><p><strong>Samuel: </strong>The best game of its kind in a genre that people have enjoyed and will play forever, well supported by compelling expansions. Plus, you can destroy your city with meteors if you&apos;re having a dark day&#x2014;like I did <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-what-happens-when-four-players-try-to-run-one-town-in-cities-skylines/\" target=\"_blank\">when I was mayor of Pipville several months ago</a>.</p>\n<h3>24. Arma 3</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 55</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Arma 3 stands alone as the highest-fidelity FPS, the best multiplayer story generator, and a bottomless trough of community missions and mods. You can play it with the utmost seriousness, with an add-on that lets you administer simulated CPR on injured comrades, or as a silly military take on Black &amp; White with its Zeus DLC. It&apos;s no coincidence that Arma was the fertile terrain that produced the last two biggest trends in PC gaming: battle royale and survival games.</p>\n<h3>23. Her Story&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 19</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil: </strong>You start with a police database open and the word &apos;MURDER&apos; entered into its search field. Hit enter and you&#x2019;re given four short video clips from a police interview. In one, the woman being interviewed says, &quot;I didn&apos;t murder Simon.&quot; OK, let&apos;s search &apos;SIMON&apos;. More video clips&#x2014;more hints at a tantalising mystery that twists and changes as you unlock more of its parts.</p><p><strong>Samuel: </strong>Probably the best mystery game ever made, because Her Story is over when you feel you&apos;ve found the answer (or when you&apos;ve discovered all the clips, depending on the type of player you are). It truly puts the drama of uncovering the truth in your hands, which is so hard for a game to do in any meaningful way. One of those games I would recommend to someone who has never played games.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Tyler: </strong>A fantastic performance that made FMV, for once, not cheesy.</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>A narrative game that really makes use of the medium. The mystery unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, which is a wonderfully original way of telling a story. What you think happened might be different to someone else&#x2019;s interpretation, turning us all into unreliable narrators.</p>\n<h3>22. Total War: Warhammer 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Total War is a complex grand strategy series that fuses turn-based 4X-style empire-building with vast real-time battles. So far we&apos;ve mostly seen the format used to explore historical scenarios, but it turns out the Warhammer universe is a perfect fit. For fans of the setting it&apos;s a joy to see each faction rendered so vividly, but I would recommend Total War: Warhammer 2 to any strategy fan regardless of your Warhammer knowledge. If you want to command a traditional army, the Empire is there for you. If you want something more adventurous, you don&apos;t need to know much about the undead Tomb Kings to enjoy sending hordes of skeletons after magical relics. The sequel&apos;s campaign is brilliant. Four factions fight for control of a big magic vortex in the middle of the map, which keeps the campaign interesting all the way into the endgame.</p><p><strong>Jody:</strong> Replay that campaign and eventually you&apos;ll see behind the curtain, but what makes it worth replaying is the factions. Warhammer 2 gets its factions right in ways that should please all but the fussiest fans, even though they&apos;re a diverse collection of uptight magic elves, dinosaur-riding lizards, sneaky rat bastards, and &quot;we&apos;re really into leather&quot; sex dungeon kink elves. That&apos;s no easy feat.</p>\n<h3>21. The Sims 4</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip:</strong> The latest instalment of the long-running life sim has absorbed many hours of my life as I generate idiotic stories starring my beloved cast of citizens. Four years after release it&apos;s at the point where features missing at launch have been patched in (toddlers! pools!) and you can use the glut of expansions, game packs and stuff packs to tailor the game to your playstyle. I&apos;d like to see the pricing model better support people who dip in and out, but overall there&apos;s still no other game like it.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>20. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2012 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 49</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan: </strong>Valve&apos;s half-hearted updates dented its ranking this year, but CS:GO remains the purest team FPS on the planet. Every round is a joust of plays, counters, and outmaneuvering, where a smart flash or reflex AWP pick shifts the balance. You can spend a lifetime improving your grenade technique, your de_inferno mid push, your eco round playcalling. It&apos;ll never be enough. Each gun is a wild animal with its own unique spray pattern and tendencies that can take dozens of hours to learn.</p>\n<h3>19. Rocket League</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 16</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> I&apos;ve hit a skill plateau in the best and only rocket car soccer game (I play the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-leagues-best-mode-is-its-least-played/\" target=\"_blank\">hockey variant</a>), but I just have to find the next slope. I don&apos;t think one can ever stop getting better at Rocket League. There&apos;s always a better position I could&apos;ve been in, an aerial I shouldn&apos;t have botched. It hasn&apos;t changed much over the years, but I feel like I could play it forever.</p>\n<h3>18. Hitman</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 14</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil: </strong>This stealth sandbox about a bald assassin features six huge, absurdly detailed maps, each filled with interesting ways to bump off your targets. Hitman&apos;s social stealth systems&#x2014;where disguises are more important than not being seen&#x2014;gives you the time to plan, experiment and refine your approach. It&apos;s now the best game in the series.</p>\n<h3>17. Kerbal Space Program</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 39</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Phil:</strong> Build a rocket, launch a rocket, fly a rocket, crash a rocket. And then do it all again&#x2014;tweaking and experimenting until your design is bona fide spacefaring craft, able to maintain orbit or visit nearby celestial bodies. Kerbal Space Program is a sublime mix of physics and slapstick that makes for the perfect playground for space exploration.</p>\n<h3>16. Spelunky</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2013 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 10</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wes: </strong>No one&apos;s topped the way Spelunky&apos;s pieces play off one another to make its world feel deeply knowable and random at the same time. It&apos;s a game you play for hundreds of hours, until getting the key to unlock the chest to find the Udjat Eye to reach the black market to buy the ankh to die and come back to life to fight Anubis to take his sceptre to unlock the City of Gold to find the Book of the Dead to journey through Hell to fight King Yama just feels like another day playing Spelunky.</p>\n<h3>15. Alien: Isolation&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2014 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 8</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> The best horror game on PC, because the thing chasing you has a mind of its own. There&apos;s no pattern to predict, no patrol route you can exploit. The alien is intelligent. It will learn your habits and it will fuck with you, and that is terrifying.</p><p><strong>Samuel:</strong> I replayed it this year, and it&apos;s amazing how much mileage they get out of the same two repeated enemies by making clever use of set pieces and different types of environments. Probably the best horror game ever.</p>\n<h3>14. Overwatch</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 13</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I love Overwatch because, as someone lacking the skill to play most other online shooters competently, I can still make a difference in a match. The sheer variety of brilliantly-designed characters and their wildly varied toolsets means there&apos;s something for every kind of player, even if they can&apos;t pull off a decent headshot. It&apos;s also impressively accessible, cleverly explaining the intricacies of its heroes&apos; abilities without overloading you with information.</p><p><strong>Bo:</strong> A year ago, Blizzard told me they had &quot;barely scratched the surface&quot; of abilities and character archetypes they&apos;d like to explore in Overwatch. With the newest hero being a giant hamster ball mech with a Spider-Man-style grappling hook piloted by a literal hamster, I&apos;m finally inclined to believe them. Overwatch continues to be one of the most unique and accessible shooters. And on the esports front, the Overwatch League&apos;s adoption of a city-based team model has ignited local enthusiasm in a way that no other game, tournament, or organization has been able to thus far.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> We decided this list&apos;s order before Wrecking Ball was announced. I&apos;ll leave you to speculate whether he would have raised or lowered Overwatch&apos;s position.</p>\n<h3>13. Life is Strange</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>Dontnod&apos;s episodic, time-rewinding teen drama develops (Look! A photography pun! Because the lead character is into photography!) from a gawky, awkward-but-sweet first episode with slightly clunky dialogue into a story capable of delivering real emotional sucker punches. It&apos;s not perfect&#x2014;some puzzle segments outstay their welcome and the plot often throws subtlety out of the window&#x2014;but OH MY! The cast of characters and the strength of their relationships elevate the whole thing, and the Instagrammy aesthetic bolsters the teenage intensity.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> It also features probably the best use of mid-&apos;00s indie boys playing sad acoustic songs about relationships and feelings in all of gaming. Max listening to Jos&#xE9; Gonz&#xE1;lez while riding a bus across Arcadia Bay is a beautiful, understated sequence that gives us the time to empathise with the character and her feelings about the town she&apos;s returned to.</p>\n<h3>12. Hollow Knight</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 46</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wes: </strong>The best Metroidvania since Super Metroid. Hollow Knight is open-ended almost to a fault, giving you a massive, decaying, interconnected bug kingdom to explore and frequently find yourself lost in. It can be overwhelming at first, but the feeling of discovery ends up being immensely rewarding as a result. The super responsive platforming and combat keep backtracking from ever feeling like a chore, something similar games have struggled with.</p>\n<h3>11. Doom</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 9</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>A modernisation of Doom that puts the focus firmly on speed and sweet guns. The DOOM reboot resists decades of shooter trends that either ape Call of Duty or try to crossbreed the FPS with other genres. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that sort of experimentation, but it&apos;s so refreshing to boot this game up and blow gooey chunks out of the forces of hell. Bring on the next one, id.</p><p><strong>Samuel:</strong> The best single-player FPS there is in 2018. A clever update of Doom that turns fights into melee-heavy duels, with a not-overly-serious tone that hits just the right spot.</p><p><strong>Wes:</strong> And the levels are actually intricate mazes full of secrets, just like classic Doom! I expected good shooting in bland corridors, but this is so much more.</p>\n<h3>10. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 6</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>I loaded back into my MGS5 save a month ago to find Snake decked out head-to-toe in a leopard skin combat suit. I forgot that my dog had a knife and my horse had a face shield, and I forgot that I named my squad TACTICAL OCTOPUS. It&#x2019;s a terrific open world stealth game, but its quirky sense of fun makes the supernatural military nonsense bearable.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Samuel: </strong>My favourite stealth action game ever, that sits somewhere between immersive sim and Metal Gear of old.</p>\n<h3>9. Dark Souls Remastered</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 2 (Prepare to Die Edition)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>Have you met Gravelord Nito? He&apos;s a roiling mass of skeletons shrouded in a cape of souls. He lives deep in Dark Souls nightmarish catacombs, and he&apos;s just one example of the game&apos;s extraordinary art direction, and powerful sense of dark fantasy horror. People go on about Dark Souls&apos; bottomless lore with good reason, but underneath the theatrics it&apos;s actually a very simple game. You raid dungeons, chop up monsters, loot chests and level up. Without strong, enduring combat fundamentals I wouldn&apos;t have kept playing long enough to uncover the gods&apos; tragic stories.</p>\n<h3>8. Subnautica</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Pip: </strong>Subnautica is my game of 2018 so far. I usually tap out pretty fast when it comes to survival games but this one takes place in a gorgeous underwater world, involves a compelling plot, AND I adore tinkering with my little underwater base. It also lets me choose how much survival-ing I care to have as part of the game experience, meaning I can switch off thirst. It&apos;s not exactly better down where it&#x2019;s wetter given the wealth of creatures and situations which can kill you, but it&apos;s exactly where I want to be.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> Exploring is genuinely rewarding, both in terms of finding resources to build cooler submarines and environmental detail. It&apos;s a world with a story to tell, and it tells it brilliantly.</p>\n<h3>7. XCOM 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 4</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>Strategy games are good at making me care about numbers and systems, but XCOM 2 is one of the few I can name that translate the numberwang into emotional investment. Losing a squad member can feel devastating. You nurture them between fights, gradually upgrading their gear and unlocking sweet new skills, only for an alien to cruelly blast them in a routine mission. When things go wrong in XCOM, they go very wrong indeed, which is all part of the drama in a game that casts humanity as the underdog.</p><p><strong>Evan: </strong>XCOM&apos;s art direction is ridiculously underrated. Its maps are believable, colorful dioramas that shatter into pieces under the heat and intensity of your insurgent combat.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>6. Rainbow Six Siege</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 15</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Evan: </strong>Sure, you can play Siege as if it&apos;s Counter-Strike, pre-firing and out-angling your opponents with snap marksmanship. But the real joy is in outsmarting the other team by poking clever holes in the maps, placing your gadgets in unexpected positions, and careful drone scouting. I also love Siege&apos;s tempo: this is a shooter that gives you time and a canvas of breakable space to stop, strategize, and execute a dumb plan with absurd gadgets like an eyeball turret that shoots lasers, invisible poison mines, and a drone that shoots concussions. Ubisoft remains devoted to supporting Siege with meaningful systems renovations and with four annual updates that add new characters and maps.</p>\n<h3>5. What Remains of Edith Finch</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 27</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel: </strong>This first-person narrative game is constantly inventive. Edith Finch ventures into the home where her family used to live, before they all died in various tragic circumstances and their rooms were sealed up. You uncover each of their stories. It&apos;s the high point of this genre.</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>Exploring the abandoned home of the eccentric Finch family and uncovering their history is one of the most satisfying storytelling experiences a game has ever given me. But it&apos;s a game I&apos;ll never play again, simply because one scene in particular was so emotionally-charged that I can&apos;t face it. Any piece of media that holds that kind of power has to be special.</p>\n<h3>4. Into the Breach</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2018 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Into the Breach is a game about quick turn-based battles between mechs and kaiju-sized bugs, and it&apos;s almost perfect. Unlike many turn-based strategy games, Into the Breach doesn&apos;t use chance to inject battles with tension&#x2014;the UI tells you pretty much everything that&apos;s going to happen next turn. The pleasure comes from solving the next turn state as efficiently as you can. It&apos;s a small game&#x2014;battles only last a few turns on an eight-by-eight grid&#x2014;but the varied mech teams and increasingly nefarious bug types create a huge amount of tactical variation. It shows that strategy games don&#x2019;t have to be long and laborious.</p><p><strong>Wes: </strong>There&apos;s so little randomness that random moments have immense impact. In one run, I had two buildings resist damage at a pivotal point. I&apos;ve never done a more exaggerated fist pump.</p>\n<h3>3. Divinity: Original Sin 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2017 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> New entry</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Divinity: Original Sin 2 feels less stodgy than other classic RPG revivals while heightening their best qualities: turn-based combat (I hate real-time, sorry) with physics-based spells and exploding barrels (necessary), great characters, and a commitment to letting players do what they want, even if it breaks everything.</p><p><strong>Wes: </strong>It offers you an intricate RPG sandbox to play in, and it invites you to break the rules in as many ways as you can imagine. The first game did that, too, but this one marries that freedom with across-the-board great writing and genuinely thoughtful roleplaying. It walks the walk and talks the talk.</p>\n<h3>2. Dishonored 2</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2016 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 3</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Samuel:</strong> This is the best stealth game there has ever been. While the high-concept levels like A Crack in the Slab and Clockwork Mansion get a lot of attention for their clever one-off twists, more traditional stages like Royal Conservatory and Dust District are so detailed and fun to explore. There&apos;s no sense of repetition, and each level feels like a huge event. It&apos;s the precision of Dishonored 2 I love. Every successful takedown or evasion feels like something you&apos;ve earned.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>Dishonored 2 has some of the best level design on PC, both in terms of the architecture and aesthetic, and in how the environments are rich playgrounds that let you really flex your creativity. Every location has something interesting about it, whether it&apos;s the time-hopping of A Crack in the Slab or the intricate house-sized puzzle box that is the magnificent Clockwork Mansion. And the sheer volume of ways to navigate the levels and complete your objectives really captures the spirit of PC gaming.</p><p><strong>Tom:</strong> I want to savour every moment in Karnaca, because those levels are so dense and fun to explore. Immersive sims have always been good at creating broad levels like these, full of sandbox opportunity, but I really value that simple acts of moving, shooting and fighting feel great in Dishonored 2. Your regenerating mana bar gives you license to use your traversal powers freely, and I love blink and Emily&#x2019;s tentacle leap. The introduction of Emily just broadens your toolset further. Domino, which lets you chain NPCs fates together so that one attack affects them all, is an inspired ability, and it&apos;s emblematic of the way Dishonored 2 builds on the tenets of immersive sims like Deus Ex, and spins them out in spectacular new ways. Augmented special forces dudes are cool, but warlock assassins are even cooler.</p><p><strong>Phil: </strong>For me it&apos;s the reactivity of the world. Yes, the combat is fluid and satisfying, the level design is intricate and beautifully balanced, and the abilities perfectly tailored for absurd displays of skill and problem solving. But what ties it all together is the lengths Arkane has gone to make it all feel believable and real. Immersive sim is, I will admit, a clunky term, but it&#x2019;s a useful way to encapsulate a core philosophy: that a game&#x2019;s systems must work to make you believe in a world, even if that world features magical parkour assassins. I believe in Dishonored 2&apos;s world because throughout I encountered ways Arkane had anticipated player behaviour. The most extreme example is found in the standout mission A Crack in the Slab, which features an alternate timeline that only occurs if you do something that&#x2019;s never asked of you&#x2014;that most people will probably never try. Arkane knew someone would try, and so made a response. That&apos;s amazing dedication to the craft.</p>\n<h3>1. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>\n<p><strong>RELEASED</strong> 2015 | <strong>LAST POSITION</strong> 1</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Tom: </strong>It&apos;s a great execution of the ronin fantasy set in one of the most beautiful worlds on PC. The craggy Skellige isle might be one of my favourite places in games, or is it Novigrad, or the sunlit vineyards of Toussaint? Even the dripping bogs in the early areas are pretty, in their own miserable way. Within these gorgeous places you meet people with interesting problems. Maybe their local well is haunted. Maybe their spouse is haunted. Usually something is haunted, or cursed, or being pursued by a hideous mythical beast. I treated the sidequests as the main quest, to be honest, roleplaying a mutant outcast on a mission to make the world a slightly better place. Oh, and let&apos;s not forget Gwent, one of the best games-within-a-game since Final Fantasy VIII&apos;s Triple Triad.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Jody: </strong>The fact you play a character with his own place in the world, including allies, enemies, and ex-girlfriends, is a definite strength of The Witcher 3. But it wasn&apos;t always this way. In the first Witcher game Geralt was an amnesiac sleazebag and honestly a bit of a tool. He wasn&apos;t a fun person to be around, let alone to be. But by The Witcher 3, Geralt&apos;s a caring father figure with a heart of gold beneath layers of beard and gruff, and more than that he feels like someone you personalise. How much he cares about getting paid, who he loves, how seriously he takes his creed, that&#x2019;s all you. The Witcher 3&apos;s version of Geralt is the perfect videogame protagonist not because he&apos;s more integrated into his world than a character you make from scratch, but because he&apos;s a solid outline with room to manoeuvre inside that. He contains multitudes&#x2014;but not too many. He has well-defined areas of doubt and uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Wes:</strong> &quot;Place&quot; really is what makes The Witcher 3 so spectacular, and like no other game I&apos;ve played. It&apos;s not just that the world is gorgeous and detailed, though it is both of those things. The Witcher 3 has this unparalleled combination of artistry and technology that makes its locations and characters feel authentic. Accents and architecture differ between the mainland and Skellige. The characters you encounter out in the world have quests that involve their families or monsters native to their region, and the more of these quests you take, the more you appreciate how natural and human they seem. No one&apos;s asking you to go out and slay five wolves because that&apos;s a good way to spend ten minutes in an RPG. If you&apos;re killing beasts, it&#x2019;s probably to save a village&apos;s flock or get revenge for a grieving father, and even straightforward quests often end with surprising deviations. Depending on how you play Geralt, you can be a mercenary in search of coin, or calmly talk someone out of a decision you know they&apos;ll regret. You can haggle with assholes who don&apos;t respect the value of a witcher&apos;s work, and you&#x2019;ll have to decide what to do when a poor farmer doesn&apos;t actually have the money he promised you. Those touches, along with the motion capture, the voice acting and the wind on a blustery night in Velen, make the whole thing come alive. What a world.</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> A thing I hate about most RPG writing is that something as simple as asking to be rewarded for your time and effort is treated as the most evil thing a protagonist can do. But in The Witcher 3, Geralt is a professional doing his job. His haggling with clients over money isn&apos;t a deviance or a crime, but the expected cost of hiring a man who is good at what he does for a living.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> I love The Witcher 3 because it&#x2019;s a game where almost everything is meaningful. When you pick up a quest, it isn&apos;t just some thinly-written excuse to get you to go kill a monster. There&apos;s a backstory, a motivation, and often a twist. Quests can spiral, turning an encounter with a peasant in a tavern into a sprawling epic that ends with you fighting some great, mythical beast atop a crumbling tower in a raging storm. The game is heaving with interesting characters and worthwhile things to do, and Geralt is the foundation of it all: a complex lead who makes other videogame characters look like cardboard cutouts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Personal picks</h3>\n<p>We love many more games than we can fit onto one list, so here the PC Gamer team has spotlighted a few of their favorites that didn&apos;t make the cut.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Philippa Warr: Cradle</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cradle, like Deadly Premonition, is wonky but fascinating and stays with you for years. It&apos;s a transhumanist puzzler where you try to repair a mechanical girl who is also a vase in a yurt on the Mongolian steppe next to an abandoned theme park which dispenses block-based minigames.</p>\n<h3>Joe Donnelly: Kentucky Route Zero</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kentucky Route Zero is wonderful. Its storylines are weird and interesting. Its minimalist art style is gorgeous. Its sprawling open road and Mark Twain-esque Echo River are a joy to explore. Its cast of characters are quirky and often funny. And it&apos;s not even finished. Look for its final act this year.</p>\n<h3>Bo Moore: Prey</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The first 20 minutes of Prey form one of the most inspired sci-fi set pieces of recent memory. An immersive sim that offers fantastic problem solving, enjoyable enough combat (even if the enemies are a bit uninspired), and, true to its pedigree, a level of environmental storytelling that rivals Rapture.</p>\n<h3>Steven Messner: Slay the Spire</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>This deckbuilding roguelike isn&apos;t out of Early Access and already I&apos;ve sunk more hours into it than I&#x2019;d care to admit. It&apos;s a deceptively simple game that anyone can easily pick up and play, but learning to build the perfect deck&#x2014;and getting all the lucky drops to pull it off&#x2014;can make hours vanish.</p>\n<h3>Tyler Wilde: Chess Ultra</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>For online chess, I recommend Chess.com. But if you want to relax with a few AI games, Chess Ultra has many of the features of pro chess software without the complexity. It&apos;s for people who just want to play chess, and it works wonderfully. The Twitch integration and VR support are cool, too.</p>\n<h3>Chris Livingston: Duskers</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Issue text commands to drones to steer them around abandoned space stations where terrifying aliens lurk. You can only see what your drones see, giving Duskers a spooky found-footage feel. It&apos;s a scary and surprising roguelike where everything going wrong is as much fun as everything going right.</p>\n<h3>Tom Senior: Thief Gold</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&apos;s surprising how well 1998&apos;s Thief still holds up. It&apos;s tense and atmospheric, and the labyrinthine levels feel huge, substantial and ambitious even today. It&apos;s punishing, and the spindly NPCs look kind of ridiculous now, but I still get the fear when I snipe out a torch with a water arrow, hoping that nobody sees it.</p>\n<h3>Phil Savage: Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>A stealth puzzler that&apos;s not afraid to make you wait. You embark on missions throughout Edo period Japan, silently breaking into well-guarded strongholds using wits, patience and an adorable raccoon dog. Deep, tactical and rewardingly tricky.</p>\n<h3>Andy Kelly: Else Heart.Break()</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a digitised world, anything can be hacked. That&#x2019;s the premise of else Heart.Break(), a unique game about love, freedom, and cybercrime. You can hack objects to change how they behave. Hero Sebastian uses his newfound coding skills to join a gang of hacktivists.</p>\n<h3>Evan Lahti: Oxygen Not Included</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The intricate systems-maths of a sim wrapped in the handmade charm of a Klei game. Within hours of starting a new colony, you&apos;re optimizing airflow and figuring out the right number of toilets to fertilize your plants. It&apos;s still in Early Access, but this is already my favorite ant farm on PC.</p>\n<h3>Samuel Roberts: Assassin&apos;s Creed Origins</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&apos;m not traditionally a fan of Ubisoft&#x2019;s series, but almost everything here, from world layout to combat to quest structure, has been revamped. I think everyone should see this open world before they die. It&apos;s a staggering creation.</p>\n<h3>James Davenport: Stories Untold</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Using a computer shouldn&apos;t be scary, but Stories Untold makes it so. The fidelity of the keys and knobs draws you into its world. Sitting at your computer while the protagonists are tormented by their own makes the events of these four short stories feel more real and unnerving.&#xA0;</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1535731141,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":220},{"gid":"2365952982523708416","title":"The Stanley Parable creator wants his next game to defy the rules of games","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2365952982523708416","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p></p>\n<p>Davey Wreden, creator of the The Stanley Parable and The Beginner&apos;s Guide, discussed his current game design goals during an indie panel at GDC 2018 today. Wreden didn&apos;t officially announce or nail down anything, but he did offer an intriguing glimpse at some of the ideas he&apos;s &quot;shooting for&quot; and what we might see next from the eccentric designer.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about why people continue playing a game after they&apos;ve started, assuming it&apos;s somewhat fun or interesting on a core mechanical level,&quot; Wreden said. &quot;Why does a person want to put in hour after after on this one game as opposed to playing a different game? What creates their engagement?&quot;</p><p>Wreden grouped the reasons for this into three categories. Firstly, to become better or to optimize, &quot;the enjoyable feeling that you are better now at the game than you were when you started playing.&quot; Secondly, to make progress, &quot;watching your number go up or gaining more items or more stuff.&quot; And thirdly, to see more content, &quot;we like the story, we like the characters, we like the world, and we want to continue to see more of it.&quot;&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&quot;To me, these three things sum up what 99.9 percent of games are doing to engage players,&quot; he continued. &quot;And we know this is effective on some level and it can be a lot of fun. We all like games like this. The question I&apos;ve been grappling with lately is, how could you make a game that is engaging, compelling and does not rely on any of these three things to make you interested?</p><p>&quot;These three points all rely on something outside the act of play itself to be interesting. With the first, you&apos;re imagining a future version of yourself who&apos;s better at the game. With the second, you&apos;re imagining a future where your number is bigger. With the third, you&apos;re imagining how cool it will be to see the rest of the story. They&apos;re all future-motivated. I would love to explore play that&apos;s engaging and compelling in this very moment, without that reliance on the future.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;The weird goal that I was setting for myself is to create a game that is intrinsically fun to play and has the kind of context that would make us say &apos;this is a videogame,&apos; but, at its core, does not rely on any of these three things to be compelling. I think they can still be there, but can they be something other than the sole direct reason why you want to continue playing?&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&quot;What would a game be like where you make interesting choices, but you can&apos;t get better at making those choices, or you can&apos;t make more optimized choices? What about a game where you&apos;re growing or making progress in an interesting way, but where the outcomes are obscure enough that you can&apos;t see what the outcomes will lead to? What about a game that has a story, but you don&apos;t need to see every piece of content to get the story?</p><p>&quot;All of these sound counterintuitive, but that&apos;s why I&apos;m so excited. The bizarre, impossible-sounding goal I&apos;ve set for myself is to create a game that does all of these things. I don&apos;t have a good answer yet as to how exactly I&apos;ll do that.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>If anyone can find a good answer to these wonky questions, it&apos;s probably Wreden. The Stanley Parable scribbled all over narrative conventions, and The Beginner&apos;s Guide was as much an intimate lecture on Wreden&apos;s design process as it was a game. He&apos;s made a name for himself by breaking the rules.

While Valve&apos;s storefront might not have Xbox&apos;s Gamerscore or PlayStation&apos;s Trophies, there are still <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/100pAG\">plenty of PC gamers</a> who appreciate the way Steam achievements challenge them to play games in new and interesting ways. Then there&apos;s the satisfaction of knowing you&apos;re one of just a small percentage of players who&apos;ve explored every nook and cranny, maxed out every stat, or earned every gold medal a game has to offer.&#xA0;</p><p>The thing is, a lot of Steam achievements are kind of boring. Kill 10,000 enemies, hit level 99 in every class, finish the game on Ultra Nightmare Hardcore difficulty&#x2014;most of the objectives feel like they&apos;ve fallen straight out of a free-to-play MMO&apos;s quest log. Even the rarest achievements are often little more than tedious grind fests, requiring you to play 500 online matches in a multiplayer game with no active player base, or fight alongside a game&apos;s developer when that developer has long ago moved onto their next project.&#xA0;</p><p>These achievements aren&apos;t particularly fun to earn, let alone read about. But buried in Steam&apos;s massive catalog of games are some truly obscure, brutally difficult achievements that less than 0.1 percent of players have managed to accomplish. These are achievements worthy of the name. Most of us will never earn them, but we can dream.</p><p>Note: Total owners approximated from <a href=\"https://steamspy.com/\">SteamSpy</a>.

That might seem odd given how simple its requirement sounds: all you have to do is survive for 500 seconds. I mean, I do that all the time. See. That last 500 seconds? I just survived that.&#xA0;</p><p>But yeah. Surviving Devil Daggers is a wee bit tougher than running out the clock in real life. Despite the game selling for a mere fiver, just 0.1 percent of players have managed to avoid croaking for the 8 minutes and 20 seconds necessary to snag the &apos;Devil Dagger&apos; achievement. <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/latest-devil-daggers-world-record-survives-hell-for-ten-minutes/\">Watching replays of those runs</a> is equal parts mesmerizing and depressing, making it painfully clear just how amateur my own skills are. I could probably spend the next year playing nothing but Devil Daggers and still not come close to the graceful death-dealing of players like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gASyYdQM0nc\">world-record-smashing bowsr</a>. When the apocalypse hits and the whole world goes to hell, I&apos;ll be the redshirt incinerated in the first ten seconds.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Crusader Kings 2</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/203770/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Not so Bad</strong></a><strong> - Survive the End Times</strong><br>\n Total Owners: 1.4 million <br>\n Completion Percentage: 0.1</p><p>Crusader Kings 2, champion of the grand strategy genre, is full of intricate, multi-layered achievements few players have managed to unlock. From installing a female ruler in the five baronies of the Orthodox Pentarchy, to trampling the Pope with a horde of elephants, over a dozen eclectic achievements are currently sitting at a completion rate of less than 0.1 percent. &#xA0;</p><p>The one I want to shout out, though, is the &apos;Not so Bad&apos; achievement awarded for surviving the End Times. Ostensibly, you unlock this achievement by surviving the rise of the Prophet of Doom and the Black Death he&apos;s convinced will destroy humanity. A Crusader Kings player going by the username <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/50pbhu/surviving_the_end_times/?st=j2lhi52n&amp;sh=16486be1\">Xolotl123 on Reddit</a>, however, inadvertently earned themselves the achievement due to their investment in high-quality hospital care and their imprisonment of the Prophet for disturbing the peace. The Prophet then hanged himself, but not before sending the player a letter that read: &apos;If you are reading this letter, I am with God, or with Lucifer..., if so, then you were right. If not, then I was right.&apos;&#xA0;</p><p>I&apos;ve not had the time to play Crusader Kings 2, but after reading this story, I think I&apos;m going to have to clear my schedule. Any game where you can avert the End Times through hygiene is a winner in my book.&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Rising Storm / Red Orchestra 2</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/RedOrchestra2/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bringing a sword to a sword fight</strong></a><strong> &#x2013; As an American soldier kill an Axis soldier wielding a Katana, with a Katana. </strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/RedOrchestra2/achievements\"><strong>Stick it to Tojo</strong></a><strong> &#x2013; As an Allied soldier, kill 100 Axis soldiers with a bayonet.<br>\n </strong>Total Owners: 2.7 million (unreliable due to free weekend) <br>\n Completion percentage: 0.1 - 0.2</p><p>Rising Storm&apos;s focus on historically authentic, asymmetrical WWII combat means that, naturally, American soldiers do not spawn into the battlefield with katanas. In order to get one, you have to defeat a Japanese soldier who&apos;s carrying one. And in order to get the &quot;Bringing a sword...&quot; achievement, you then have to pick up their katana, find <em>another</em> Japanese soldier with a katana, and then defeat them with the weapon of their ancestors. It&apos;s a hard scenario to concoct in an FPS where rifles and grenades are the preferred way to fight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Bit.Trip Beat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/BitTrip/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MEAT.BOY SMELLS </strong></a>- Get a perfect in 1-1 using only a game pad.<br>\nTotal Owners: 311,00<br>\nAchievement percentage: 1.6</p><p>Heresy! An achievement that requires ditching the holy mouse and keyboard for a filthy gamepad? What does BIT.TRIP BEAT take us for, console players? Everyone knows a good M+K combo is the only way to play. Sure, it makes driving games a bit twitchy, and performing combos in third-person action games can be tricky without analogue sticks, and fighting games don&apos;t always work so great, and stealth sequences tend to be a little wonky with WASD&#x2026;</p><p>Okay. So maybe gamepads aren&apos;t that bad. Still, locking an achievement to a specific piece of hardware is a surefire way to tick off achievement hunters. The BIT.TRIP devs found that out the hard way with the game&apos;s<a href=\"http://astats.astats.nl/astats/Steam_Achievement_Info.php?AchievementID=20&amp;AppID=63700&amp;SteamID64=76561197984005622\"><ins> &apos;SIXTH.SENSE&apos; achievement</ins></a>, which required players to beat a level using Razer&apos;s short-lived Sixense motion controller. <a href=\"http://www.astats.nl/AStatsForum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=629&amp;view=previous\"><ins>The</ins></a><a href=\"http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1567554\"><ins> backlash</ins></a> to &apos;SIXTH.SENSE&apos; drove the devs to delete the achievement from Steam completely, which technically makes it one of the rarest achievements out there. Not quite as rare as a game with motion controls that don&apos;t feel like total garbage, but still&#x2026;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Stanley Parable</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/221910/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Go outside</strong></a><strong> - Don&apos;t play The Stanley Parable for five years </strong><br>\nTotal Owners: 2.1 million <br>\nNumber of achievers: <a href=\"http://astats.astats.nl/astats/Steam_Achievement_Info.php?AchievementID=6&amp;AppID=221910\">2 verified through AStats</a> (6.9 percent on Steam)&#xA0;</p><p>Games are meant to be played&#x2014;we usually take that much for granted. It&apos;s a little odd, then, when a game actively encourages you not to play it. Odd, however, is what The Stanley Parable&apos;s all about. I mean, one of the game&apos;s endings involves running back and forth between two buttons for four hours. And that&apos;s not to mention the pointed commentary on the nature of free will and the human tendency towards obeisance. Like I said, odd.&#xA0;</p><p>The Stanley Parable&apos;s weirdest elements, however, are definitely its achievements. In addition to an achievement simply entitled &apos;Unachievable&apos; (paradoxically earned by 3.9 percent of players), there&apos;s the &apos;Go outside&apos; achievement that tasks players with not playing the game for five years straight. Since The Stanley Parable released in October 2013, no one can legitimately earn this achievement until October next year. Of course, that hasn&apos;t stopped some unscrupulous Steam users from setting their computer clocks forward to unlock the achievement early. &#xA0;</p><p>Cheating to <em>not</em> play a game? I guess some people will do anything for their sweet cheevos.&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Garry&apos;s Mod</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/GarrysMod/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Addict</strong></a><strong> - You have wasted a year of your life playing GMod! </strong><br>\nTotal Owners: 13.2 million <br>\nNumber of achievers: <a href=\"http://astats.astats.nl/astats/Steam_Achievement_Info.php?AchievementID=5&amp;AppID=4000\">9 verified on AStats</a> (1.8 percent on Steam)&#xA0;</p><p>You can do a lot of things in the 8760 hours that make up a single year. You could play 105,120 matches of Rocket League. You could marathon the entire current run of The Simpsons&#x2014;all 617 episodes&#x2014;38 times over. You could hitch a ride on a rocket and fly to Mars, with enough time left over to <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-pc-review/\">plant the seeds of an interplanetary rebellion</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>You could also spend every one of those 8760 hours playing Garry&apos;s Mod in order to unlock the &apos;Addict&apos; achievement. And when I say playing, I don&apos;t just mean booting up the game and letting it idle in the menu. You have to be connected to an active server for your time to count. Unsurprisingly, the hefty investment involved has kept the achievement&apos;s completion percentage at just 1.8 percent, even with achievement hunters over at AStats <a href=\"http://astats.astats.nl/astats/Steam_Achievement_Info.php?AchievementID=5&amp;AppID=4000\">devising strategies</a> for minimizing the resources used by Garry&apos;s Mod so you can leave it running in the background while you tend to other tasks.&#xA0;</p><p>I have to wonder, though, how many people left their computers on while they were working or sleeping solely to unlock this achievement? At a modest estimate, 8760 hours&apos; worth of electricity would cost roughly $210 USD, which is a whole lot of money for a single achievement. Kind of puts all those pesky microtransactions to shame, doesn&apos;t it?&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Train Simulator</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/TrainSimulator2014/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DLC scenarios </strong></a><br>\nTotal Owners: 995,000 <br>\nCompletion percentage: 0</p><p>Speaking of money, Train Simulator boasts some of the rarest achievements on Steam, but that&apos;s not because they&apos;re brutally difficult or stubbornly obscure. Heck, the achievement descriptions make it pretty obvious what you&apos;ve got to do: the &apos;It Works For Dogs!&apos; achievement reads &apos;Awarded for completing scenario [RailfanMode] Barking. It&apos;s not like the game&apos;s unpopular either, with nearly a million owners on Steam and a median playtime of a respectable 7.5 hours.&#xA0;</p><p>No, what makes Train Simulator&apos;s achievements so rare is that fiendish friend of ours: DLC. Train Simulator is notorious for having the most expensive DLC on Steam, with its total value <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator/\">currently sitting at $6254.43 USD</a>. Worse, Train Simulator ties many of its achievements to its DLC, leading to a wealth of 0 percent and 0.1 percent completion rates across the board. &#xA0;</p><p>But that $6254.43? I&apos;d want a real honest-to-god train if I was forking over that much cash. If it was anything like Train Simulator, though, it&apos;d probably lock out the train whistle as premium DLC. Steam whistle: only $0.99 per toot!&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Ark: Survival Evolved</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/346110/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Artifact Archaeologist</strong></a> &#x2013; You personally retrieved all Eight Artifacts! <br>\nTotal Owners: 4.7 million <br>\nCompletion Percentage: 0.2</p><p>A whole lot of people play ARK: Survival Evolved, and yet even the most common of its seven achievements has been earned by less than 5 percent of players. But while 95 percent of ARK players haven&apos;t defeated the game&apos;s first Ultimate Life Form, 99.8 percent remain vexed by its toughest achievement: &apos;Artifact Archaeologist&apos;, rewarded for retrieving every Artifact in the game. It sounds simple enough, but this is where ARK&apos;s nature as an Early Access game comes back to bite it on the rump. &#xA0;</p><p>According to the achievement description, there are only eight artifacts in ARK: Survival Evolved. This isn&apos;t true. There are 14 artifacts in total, 10 of which can be obtained through normal play, 3 which are locked to the Scorched Earth DLC, and one which can only be spawned through a console command. For a game that has already <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-biggest-pc-gaming-controversies-of-2016/\">seen its fair share of controversy</a>, ARK has left <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/1318836262670348568/\">quite</a> a <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/133259956015204016/\">few</a> achievement hunters pretty disappointed. Still, at least they can take solace in the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/ark-update/\">giant bees</a> that have just been added to the game. That&apos;s something, right? &#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/489830/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dragonrider</strong></a> - Tame and ride 5 dragons <br>\nTotal Owners: 11 million (unreliable due to free weekend) <br>\nCompletion percentage: 0.8</p><p>I&apos;m going to go out on a limb here and assume you&apos;ve played Skyrim, or at least heard enough about it to understand the game&apos;s premise. You&apos;re the dragonborn, you need to save the world from an evil dragon, yada yada yada. In short, the game basically revolves around dragons.&#xA0;</p><p>How, then, is the achievement for riding dragons so rare? Only 0.8 percent of the millions of Skyrim players have tamed five or more of the mythical creatures and taken to the skies, which makes exactly zero sense to me. Who wouldn&apos;t want a dragon as their personal chauffeur? It&apos;s not like you&apos;d have to worry about anyone jacking your scaly pal; any thief foolish enough to try would be charred to a crisp before they could shout Fus Ro Dah. I guess Skyrim players are just too busy <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/skyrim-sex-mods/\">getting busy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-life-and-times-of-skyrims-best-dragon-macho-man-randy-savage/\">fighting Macho Man Randy Savage</a> to spend their time becoming certified dragon pilots.&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Black Mesa</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/362890/achievements\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rare Specimen</strong></a> &#x2013; Send the Hidden Hat to Xen. <br>\nTotal Owners: 500,000 <br>\nCompletion percentage: 2.1 percent&#xA0;</p><p>Hats are all the rage these days. I have it on good authority from my stock broker that the hat economy is only going to go up&#x2014;and that&apos;s coming from a man who wears a top hat, so you know it&apos;s legit. My wardrobe is already full of baseball caps, bowler hats, fezes, and beanies, just waiting for the day when my fabric fortune will be ready to claim. The only thing I don&apos;t quite understand is why my broker keeps mentioning Dota. Eh, never mind. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing.&#xA0;</p><p>Video games, it turns out, are just as keen to cash in on the hat craze. Black Mesa, the fan-made recreation of the original Half-Life, adds in the &apos;Rare Specimen&apos; achievement that tasks good old Gordon Freeman with locating a hidden purple top hat and lugging it all the way from the Black Mesa Research Facility on Earth to the alien dimension of Xen. It might not sound that tricky, but apparently Gordon&apos;s more interested in trivial things like saving the world instead of securing his future in the hat economy--only 2.1 percent of players have carried the top hat all the way to its new interdimensional marketplace.&#xA0;</p><p>Wait, that gives me an idea. What if I started selling digital hats instead of physical ones? Ooh, I think I&apos;m onto something here. I better stop typing before someone beats me to the punch&#x2026;&#xA0;</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1495211038,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":4000},{"gid":"91593954414292880","title":"The Stanley Parable update fixes weird \"Baby Game\" monolith bug","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/91593954414292880","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p></p>\n<p>The acclaimed first-person exploration game <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-stanley-parable/\">The Stanley Parable</a> has been out for a few years now, and so you might think that its days of being updated are well behind it. But you&apos;d be wrong. In a post at <a href=\"http://www.galactic-cafe.com/2016/12/a-few-words-about-the-baby-game/\">galactic-cafe.com</a>, co-creator Davey Wreden explained that a bizarre black monolith that appears at the conclusion of an equally bizarre mini-game that nobody was actually supposed to complete isn&apos;t meant to be there. And he feels pretty bad about the whole thing.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;Somewhere in the making of Stanley Parable, someone had the idea that it would be really funny if there was a mini-game that you had to play that was really tedious and not at all fun, and that the game should ask you to play it for 4 hours. Thus the Baby Game was born: a game in which the baby crawls from right to left into the fire, and you press a button to delay the baby&#x2019;s death by a few seconds, over and over, for 4 hours,&quot; Wreden explained.&#xA0;</p><p>Naturally, the developers assumed that nobody would actually do this, but on the off-chance that someone might be so persistent Wreden slapped a brief message about &quot;the essence of divine art&quot; at the end of the thing and called it a day. And of course people <em>did</em> do it, and saw the message, and also that black monolith, which lends the whole thing an air of vaguely sinister mystery. But the monolith is a bug: It is, in fact, the remains of a sliding door that got past the testers because nobody bothered to test it.&#xA0;</p><p>It&apos;s not the presence of the monolith that&apos;s the problem, though, but that it&apos;s covering up some of the text in the Baby Game message: that, and the fact that, in retrospect, it all feels a little &quot;cheap&quot; to get a 95-word message in exchange for four hours of clicking a button. &quot;I guess if I had watched someone play it ahead of time I would have tried to go back and do something to make the ending feel more substantial. But like I said, we never really assumed anyone would actually do it, so I never bothered to put myself in the shoes of someone who might play it to completion,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Years later I still feel weird about it.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>Since it&apos;s too late to make the payoff more meaningful, Wreden said the least he can do is make it legible. Hopefully. &quot;That&#x2019;s the reward we intended people to get, so dammit that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re gonna get,&quot; he continued. &quot;The update we&#x2019;re pushing today will remove the monolith and make all the text legible... I believe. I have not tested it.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>In lieu of spending four hours keeping a baby from crawling into a fire, you can read the full message, <em>sans monolith</em>, below.&#xA0;</p><p><em>Fear me, Mortal. I am the essence of divine art.</em><br>\n<em>Others but you cannot read this text.</em><br>\n<em>Know that when you die, I will personally carry your spirit across the River Blxwxn, into my garden built within the emotions of a flower.</em><br>\n<em>There we will live together, we will dance and eat and sin and you will do improv comedy based on suggestions from me for all eternity.</em><br>\n<em>This is your reward for your work here today.</em><br>\n<em>Now.

It   s nice! I like it when games feel self-contained, when I can go to bed at night with the entirety of the experience neatly laid out in my mind   s eye like an intricate quilt of motivations and rising and falling action. I don   t have to think anymore, it   s over with, resolved. <br>\n<br>\nBut the games that push back against resolution and bury themselves in my subconscious are the ones that stick, for better or worse. Some defy the expected structure of the game and cut things off before they get started, others spin out into surreal nightmare experiments that would keep David Lynch up at night. Because we   re directly involved with pushing the game towards a conclusion, it   s when they attempt to subvert and rattle my senses rather than ride along with them that I feel most vulnerable   and why I   ll always fear Regis Philbin. Find out why in our list of some of the most abrupt, bizarre game endings out there. <br>\n<br>\n<em><strong>Spoiler warning: </strong></em><em>it should be obvious, but we   re going to talk about some of the most surprising moments in these games, and some are fairly recent, so proceed with caution.</em></p>\n<h3>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain&#xA0;</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/psK_qKR9kHo\"></iframe>\n<p>I remember being pretty dissatisfied with the ending of Metal Gear Solid 5, but in the rearview, I think it   s only because it comes after a slow, repetitive second act when compared to the first. But the big twist is actually pretty cool. In the end, it   s revealed that the player character was in fact <em>not</em> Big Boss, but the    Phantom   , an MSF medic that the original Big Boss used as a front to work behind the scenes. After the helicopter crash in Ground Zeroes, Big Boss took the opportunity to use hypnotherapy and plastic surgery to make    you    a spitting image of him. As a metaphor, it   s a sweet gesture, one that indicates MGS players were an important force in the long term success of the series, and for lore aficionados, it plugs in a few plot holes in its half-century span.</p>\n<h3>The Stanley Parable - the art ending&#xA0;</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7GAtSIy4-w\"></iframe>\n<p>In a grand test of patience (and the essential act of playing a videogame), The Stanley Parable   s strangest ending involves pressing a big red button to prevent a cardboard baby from entering a fire. A few hours in and another button is thrown into the mix, this time preventing a cardboard puppy from drowning. Juggling those two buttons for a few more hours will reveal the true meaning of art to the player if they   re patient enough. It   s an interesting test in player motivation, and unsurprisingly, it didn   t take long for someone to get through it. Anything for art.</p>\n<h3>Who Wants to be a Millionaire - Regis flips</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mV_Z5ICGROo\"></iframe>\n<p>Who knew trauma could come in a cereal box? Regis Philbin, host of the once popular game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire provided his voice and likeness for a free CD version of the game that came with General Mills cereal for a limited time back at the turn of the millennium. But CD Regis has no chill. It   s not just during the player select screen that he runs out of patience with lightning ferocity, Regis loses his shit if you take long doing nearly anything at all. If you don   t type your name, he   ll type    Kathie Lee    and the questions will be easier, and if you don   t answer during the Fastest Finger contest, Regis gets angry and turns the game off. If I spent my formative years living in a dark cell full of Honey Nut Cheerios, I   m not sure I   d have the greatest disposition either, I suppose. Just leave Kathie out of this.</p>\n<h3>Far Cry 4 - finished in 15 minutes</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnCed-hb53E\"></iframe>\n<p>During the earliest moments of Far Cry 4 you meet Pagan Min, the murky, unhinged antagonist. After a tense scene at the dinner table, he   ll leave to attend to an urgent matter. Most players typically bail at this point   I mean, Pagin licks your mother   s ashes off his finger. I   d bail too. But if you wait it out 15 minutes or so, he   ll return and take you to your mother   s grave, which is where you wanted to go in the first place. So you spread her ashes, feel feelings, and then Min asks if you   re ready to shoot some goddamn guns. Credits roll and the game ends at which point most folks take Min   s advice and start over. I do wonder about the one person that found that ending and returned the game, or possibly felt like it worked and never touched Far Cry 4 again. If you exist, email me.</p>\n<h3>Silent Hill 2 - Dogs rule the world</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUDcSeUvkOw\"></iframe>\n<p>There isn   t much to say about the secret dog ending in Silent Hill 2. It   s baffling. By finding the Dog Key and entering the observation room of the Lakeview Hotel, James opens the door to find Mira, a shiba inu, operating a series of buttons and levers. He breaks down, in disbelief that a dog was behind the series of nightmarish events that led him to this point. It   s popularly considered a joke ending, but I   ll die on the canon hill. I mean, the credits are a dopey montage of clips featuring characters from the game set to a song sung by the powerful pooch in a series of barks and yips. It   s adorable, and given the context, absolutely horrifying.</p>\n<h3>Dishonored - a foiled plot&#xA0;</h3>\n<iframe  src=\"https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v76157943\" width=\"620\" height=\"378\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>OK, so this one isn   t a fair entry since it requires taking advantage of some game-breaking glitches, but it   s too funny to leave out.   At the beginning of Dishonored, Corvo is framed for the assassination of the empress and kidnapping her daughter. The event sets up the rest of the game, a dozen or so hours of infiltration missions set across Dunwall. At Summer Games Done Quick, <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-beat-dishonored-by-stopping-the-empress-assassination-in-the-intro/\"><ins>speedrunner DrTChops showed us</ins></a> how he could prevent the assassination and kidnapping from happening at all, as broken as his method might be. Watch the video to see him work his way toward the assassins before they initiate their attack and kill them, at which point the screen kicks to black. It   s a silly Groundhog   s Day solution to a problem that doesn't    really need solving, and a funny demonstration of games can be entertaining long after their intent has been exhausted.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick/v/76157943?t=16h42m38s\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Start the video at </em><em><strong>16:42:00</strong></em><em> to see for yourself.</em></a></p>\n<h3>Furi - life in paradise&#xA0;</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aqikwv2Pqfs\"></iframe>\n<p>Before attacking The Stranger, the sixth boss The Song gives him a chance to hang out with her on her floating island Oasis for eternity. If you walk on by, she   ll get angry and attack you, but if you hang out in on the island for a while, she   ll thank you, talk about your lovely future together, and the credits will roll. For a game all about intense, intimate combat, I was pleasantly surprised to find an option hidden in the halfway point that rewards the exact opposite.</p>\n<h3>Portal 2 - Space!&#xA0;</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NABJVXOgiA\"></iframe>\n<p>Portal 2   s closing moments acknowledge that there   s no such thing as a perfect ending. There will always be loose threads, plot holes, and burning questions, so Valve opted instead for a soothing salve: the musical number. After defeating Wheatley by shooting a portal on the moon and banishing him to space   as if this ending wasn   t rad enough   GLaDOS returns to her big robot body and instead of killing you, asks to be left alone. Freedom is imminent, but on the elevator ride up turrets big and small and leopard-printed sing a final farewell song before you   re coughed up into a field of golden wheat with a scorched companion cube for company. Hooray? Hooray.</p>\n<h3>Inside - the blob</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3M7QTHV9Pw\"></iframe>\n<p>I think about Inside on a weekly basis now   how it uses a slight, subdued color palette and precise animations to communicate more powerful bits of body horror than the best in the biz. Whether it   s the shake of a dog   s head as it rips at the leg of a small boy or the light crunch and irregular fold after miscalculating a dangerous leap, Inside knows how to do discomfort. And no moment demonstrates it better than the final 15 to 20 minutes of the game, where the player character is subsumed into an amorphous blob of writhing, moaning limbs. You help the blob escape the facility, bursting through panes of bulletproof glass, over an unlucky person or two, and eventually through the outermost wall of the facility, limbs scraping and clawing and twisting all the while.  </p><p>To see such a confusion of familiar human pieces and pained voices come together as something inhuman, and then to <em>help</em> the horrifying inhuman thing achieve a goal is one of the more trying exercises in empathy I   ve experienced in a game. And it worked. After escaping and rolling down a forested hill, the blob comes to rest on the beach. The voices go silent and the limbs go limp. A ray of light splits through the clouds, the waves gently lap at the shore. I felt relief for the creature, glad it finally had a chance to rest. The credits roll and it   s over. Why do I feel good?</p>\n<h3>Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy - uhhh&#xA0;</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA99I2keowU\"></iframe>\n<p>I played this game from tip to toe in one or two sittings when it came out and I still can't parse what's going on here. It   s hard to believe that the amazing opening diner sequence wasn   t even close to an indication of what was coming. In the span of a few hours, Indigo Prophecy went from covering up a unintentional murder with police on the way in a timed, consequential adventure game format, to whatever this is. There   s flying dudes with some cyber powers I think. They fight in the air and shoot colored lines at one another. Something about figuring out what to do with his new cyber powers, a big storybook tree, and the credits roll. Someone please translate.</p>\n<h3>The Witness - Urine Jug: Origins</h3>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4-C9dUOHxw\"></iframe>\n<p>I have to hand it to The Witness. For a game all about drawing lines, it really carries the theme through in the true ending. After riding the Wonka elevator into the sky and getting the credits, if you continue in a new game, a certain sky-themed puzzle might pop out at you from the very first room you start in. Theoretically, you can    finish    The Witness in the first minute of playing it. After you figure it out, a door opens and you get a behind the scenes, upscale-hotel-looking tour of a previously invisible building. There are some audio logs lying around that speak the credits aloud, and at the end, well.<br>\n<br>\nYou pass through the darkness and into the real world via a short video shot by a camera attached to Jonathan Blow   s head. He meanders around the development studio, noticing patterns from The Witness all around him before looking up into the sky as the shot fades to white.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1474124437,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":217980},{"gid":"252586225973015376","title":"Have You Played The Beginner s Guide?","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/252586225973015376","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Brendan Caldwell)","contents":"<p><img src=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/16/aug/aug_hyp_beginnersguide2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/have-you-played/\">Have You Played?</a> is an endless stream of game retrospectives.

It features voice acting by British comedian Simon Amstell, formerly the host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, who seems to be having a bit of a stressful time explaining exactly what it is you'll be doing on this job. And that's really all I can tell you about it, because the guy who's supposed to write the Steam store description went on strike midway through as a result of what he claims are intolerable working conditions. Personally, I think he's overreacting a bit, but on the other hand who wants to get eaten by a tiger, right?</p><p>\n\tFortunately we have the trailer playing above to clear things up, and even more fortunately, it's free, so you can just leap in and see what's up without having to fork over any of your hard-earned wealth.
