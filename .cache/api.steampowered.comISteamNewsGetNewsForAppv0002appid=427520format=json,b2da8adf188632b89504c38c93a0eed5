We have recently finished quite a few which we would like to show you.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/e45ceb7bb13825d0e5efb96b8be770f67fd2517f.png[/img]\n\nCompared to some of the early versions of remnants, you can now really recognize which entity got destroyed.\n\n[h1]General[/h1]\nIf you have been following the progress of remnants in 0.17 experimental versions, you have probably noticed that a lot of them have been changed quite drastically. In general we are trying to hit the balance between having the remnant look destroyed enough, yet still very well recognizable which entity it was.\n\nThis is especially difficult for tall entities as the player has to be able to walk over their remnant, the extreme case being train stop for which we are also implementing a special solution...\n\n[h1]Train stop[/h1]\nTrain stops are recognizable because of the top coloured part, and the tall scaffold that holds it. Giving the station a colour mask was trivial graphically, but our dear posila needed to add a bit of code to support remnants to have colour masks. Keeping the tall tower is a bigger problem as if the tower is a part of the remnant sprite, the player would be able to just walk over it, and trains would always show on top of it as well. We chose to split the train stop remnant into two layers so the illusion of height is kept.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/f07547b6c38b19bd1e5859fd00816353f3c867a0.gif[/img]\n\n[h1]Remnants with colour masks[/h1]\nWe also used the colour masks for basically everything the player has the ability to change the primary colours of. It includes the Locomotive, Turrets, Car and the Tank. Once the entity dies, the colour of the given entity stays with the remnant.\n\n[h1]Walls[/h1]\nWe have updated the wall sprites as well, as we wanted to make the walls more like broken walls instead of random rubble, to break their line less. The walls are by far the most destroyed entities besides turrets so they can look repetitive quickly. To improve this, wall remnants have several sprite variations.\n\nCompared to 0.16, whenever any entity gets destroyed, the player can tell which entity it was. We believe this makes rebuilding your factory much more fun, and seeing your things get eaten less frustrating. On top of that, we plan to utilize the remnants to a large degree in the campaign for 1.0 for half-destroyed factories to be found and explored.\n\nWe will be adding more remnants and improving some further to make this effect even greater than it is currently in 0.17.\n\n[h1]Community spotlight - Industrial revolution[/h1]\nIn the past month I had the opportunity to balance test an overhaul mod called [url=https://forums.factorio.com/69187]Industrial Revolution[/url]. Now, after around 1,000 hours of development, Deadlock has finally released the mod to the public today. In the around 65 hours I have spent playing the mod, I fell in love with it and I want to present it to you here.\n\n[url={STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/661c0ac191d88dc19193c101e1dc8157bd83f8c4.jpg][img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/661c0ac191d88dc19193c101e1dc8157bd83f8c4.jpg[/img][/url]\n[i]Click to see full resolution[/i]\nMy current base, machines from all ages forming one big factory.\n\nThe mod gives more depth and length to the vanilla experience by changing the progression throughout the entire game. You work through ages of technology, always chasing the milestone of the next material. Just like in vanilla, you start out with the stone age and classic burner machinery. Automation is key, even in the stone age; the mod adds new intermediate products to all crafting steps. To allow automation at this stage, the mod provides burner assembling machines and labs.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/729a8ced4bf0d305064502e35ee94670495a96dd.png[/img]\n\nHowever, instead of getting to power as soon as possible, the next goal is bronze, an alloy made from the two starting resources, tin and copper. After improving the factory with bronze machines and automating logistics science packs, the iron age is not far away. With it come steam power, oil processing and trains, allowing rapid expansion of the factory. The steel age unlocks better ore refining techniques and powerful machinery, paving the way to the rocket. Beyond the ages, the mod introduces new types of turrets, each with their advantages and disadvantages. On top of all these gameplay differences, the mod boasts incredible graphics and good sounds.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/48b961a3cad252a1282927074fb85edcf0097005.png[/img]\n\nWhen I started testing the mod, I was expecting a long-ish casual playthrough with some different recipes. What I got instead was an addiction and a huge appreciation for the concepts the mod adds and changes: Different challenges, more logistic puzzles and completely new recipes refreshing the whole experience. The extended burner phase in the mod introduced an unconventional problem to me: Fueling burner inserters and assemblers. Combined with my spaghetti approach and limited space due to the enemies lurking in the desert around me, fueling inserters became a challenge that I spent hours on.\n\nMy proudest creation is an electric motor assembler, it needs four inputs, all supplied by burner inserters that need to be fueled by other inserters. The assembler stands to this day:\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/bc50e0c2b4d63016cc63a39fdab5a800556cc77e.png[/img]\n\nAnother great change by the mod is how it deals with ore processing. Ore processing allows the player to improve how many ingots can be produced from ore, up to producing twice as many ingots. This happens in steps, every age introduces a new technology to refine ore. So, getting more iron means building an extra ore processing step and simply connecting it between the last processing step and smelting. Each refining setup has its own challenges such as multiple outputs or needing a catalyst, so it becomes an interesting puzzle to get more ingots. The new ore processing flows well with the rest of the game; often times I found that I needed an ore refining byproduct and more ore refining at the same time. This is a big improvement compared to the vanilla way of getting more plates: Mine yet another ore patch and smelt it in the same old boring way.\n\n[url={STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/04a7597bb213b9019ff185a012d517db2bd3258b.jpg][img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/04a7597bb213b9019ff185a012d517db2bd3258b.jpg[/img][/url]\n[i]Click to see full resolution[/i]\nGold being mined, crushed and purified to increase its yield before smelting it, all in the same area.\n\nOf course, adding more intermediates also means that you run the risk of only ever needing a product for one other recipe. The mod manages to avoid this pitfall, I find myself routing belts and pipes through half the factory because an item is needed in multiple different places. Another possible problem is the long burner phase, it could delay automatic construction. This is prevented by the addition of very early personal construction robots. The clockwork punkbots can be used with an automatically refuelling burner generator that fits into heavy armor, all available in the bronze age.\n\nVanilla’s boring defenses become more varied with the new turret types. The first turret you unlock is a bronze scattergun turret, it works similarly to a shotgun. These turrets are great at taking out groups and still make up a large part of my defenses. However, their range is lower than that of medium spitters, therefore minigun turrets and laser turrets guard my more commonly attacked areas.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/12002589/620d2dcb0d85f7c9bab7b24dfedd0800b1a2c513.png[/img]\n\nAll in all, the mod overhauls vanilla to provide fresh challenges, is well balanced and on top of that nice to look at. I hope you will have as much fun playing the mod as I did, so try it out now that it is released ([url=https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution]Mod portal page[/url]).\n\nAs always, let us know what you think on our [url=https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=38]forum.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567798189,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":427520},{"gid":"2413288973185940444","title":"Version 0.17.68 released","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2413288973185940444","is_external_url":true,"author":"posila87","contents":"[h1][b]Changes[/b][/h1]\n [list]\n   [*]Pressing ESC while catching up to a multiplayer game will open the menu with most options disabled.

We want to get these bugs solved before we do another release (another stable candidate). As it turns out, the only person with the skillset to fix these specific train signal bugs is also deep into levelling his Priest...\r\n\r\nWe are still making the rest of the preparations for the stable release. We have started writing up the stable annoucement blog post, and have produced a 0.17 postcard image. Other than the few more critical rail bugs, there doesn't look like there is much else to block the stable release, on the forum we are down to 27 bugs.\r\n\r\nSince there are so few bugs left to deal with, some of the team has starting working on 'post-stable' features. Wheybags is working on the new campaign, Oxyd is diving into some detailed pathfinder improvements, and Rseding has started work on some particle optimizations. We will delve deeper into these topics and more in future FFFs, as we always love to do.\r\n\r\n[h1]Glowing Heat pipes[/h1]\r\nHeat pipes were released with 0.15, since then, we (the GFX department) contracted a debt with this feature. The original plan was to be able to visualize the amount of heat by using a glow on the pipes. Due to the tight schedule of the 0.15 release we decided to postpone the feature.\r\nFinally Ernestas took care of it, and we can proudly present it integrated in the game.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/648318217dbda5ff89371c6fb540890bc944ede2.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the pipes emit light due to the red hot metal. The fact that they are connected to the reactor and the heat exchanger, made us make some extra patches. It would look wrong if the heat pipes were glowing, but the pipes on the reactor were not. The final result apart from beautiful is also very readable for the player, which is the main point of the entire design.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/e4782461ddd908c74aa98399d13395d02cb0924d.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThe glow intensity is proportional to the heat. Now the visualisation should be crystal clear.

Stable should be released next week, but with some people on vacation (Ben, Jitka, kovarex, Klonan, Sanqui) and with the release of WoW Classic, it might get slowed down a bit. (By the way, some of us will be playing on Pyrewood Village, Alliance, so if you want to have the chance of meeting Twinsen, kovarex or dominik while leveling, you can join that server).\r\n\r\nSo since there's not much happening, this week we decided to explore some unpopular or controversial opinions about the game from within the team.\r\n\r\nIn Wube we don't have a very strict management structure, everyone is free to have ideas and opinions about almost all aspects of the game. This means that with almost every change we argue and discuss a lot before making a final decision. Sometimes we argue about everything, from the smallest GUI change, to how a major feature should work. This is probably not a bad thing since this means changes are usually well thought out and unpopular ideas or changes don't make it to the game very often. Some people feel quite strongly about their opinions or sometimes the team is very divided on what should we do. Today we'll share some of those opinions and controversies. \r\n\r\n[b]Keep in mind that these are simply opinions and none of them will actually make it into the game, we are simply sharing them to have an interesting discussion.[/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]Inserters should not chase items[/h1]\r\nWhat I always liked about Factorio is that it's a very precise game. Ratios, throughputs, crafting times are all well explained and even if it gets complicated, everything can be calculated to the last item. Miners mine resources at a precise rate, smelters and assemblers craft items at a precise speed, belts move the items at a precise throughput. But inserters... due to their behavior where they track items on the belt before grabbing them, they don't have a precise throughput. This really grinds my Iron gear wheels, as it's hard to even know if an inserter will be fast enough to load a simple assembler. There are [url=https://wiki.factorio.com/Inserters]Wiki Tables[/url] and [url=https://factoriocheatsheet.com/#inserter-throughput]References[/url], but they are ridiculously complex since it depends on the inserter type, source, destination, belt type, belt orientation and inserter capacity bonus. Even after accounting for all that, the numbers are still not precise since it depends on timings and how items are placed on the belt.\r\n\r\nMy proposition is to remove this complex movement of item chasing and have inserters move to their predefined pickup location and immediately pick up the closest item (in the case of a belt).This will:\r\n[list][*]Make inserters have a constant throughput. It will still depend on some factors like stack size (e.g. stack inserter will pick up faster from chest than from belt), but it should simplify things significantly and allow us to have a calculated throughput for chests and belts that we can show in inserter tooltips.[/*][*]Prevent all the issues with inserters getting stuck (e.g. burner inserters running out of fuel because they chase items they can not grab). We often argue if this is a bug or not and if it should be fixed.[/*][*]Improve performance (maybe significantly). Inserters currently chase items throughout it's entire swing, tracking the items on the belt each tick and searching for a new item each time one goes outside the belt (which happens quite often for blue belts). Removing this requirement would mean less memory access to other entities and much simpler mathematical calculations. Since inserters are the second most common built entity, these improvements could lead to a big UPS boost.[/*][/list]\r\nBut on the other hand, this will mean:\r\n[list][*]It will graphically look much worse. While I believe we can do many things to make this look good enough (by separating drawing animation logic from game logic), it will probably not look as nice as it does now.[/*][*]It will remove some of the nice organic feel of the game. And it will remove some (arguably) fun emergent situations.[/*][/list]\r\nCombine this with the fact that changing something so core to Factorio in such a significant way would have big implications. So we decided this wont be done. \r\n\r\n[h1]Blueprint import/export should be a modded feature[/h1]\r\nThe blueprint library has always been a controversial topic. We argued about how it should work technically, in multiplayer or if it should exist at all. But one thing that I particularly don't like is blueprint import/export. It's obvious that it's more fun to make your own setups and it's probably universally agreed within the team that importing large sections of factories is not what players should do. This promotes \"instant gratification\", it eliminates the satisfaction you feel after finishing your creation you spent hours tinkering and planning. And could easily make a 100-hour game into an 10-hour game. It's sad when we release an update and the first comment is \"does anyone have the blueprint string for the nuclear reactors\" or someone immediately asks for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/0/2906376154331772625/]an artillery shell production blueprint[/url].\r\n\r\nIt's our job as developers to incentivise the player to play the game properly. If importing blueprints is obviously so bad, why are we providing this tool as a vanilla tool? Not only that but we also place it in the \"tools\" section, as a shortcut in the main screen, as if you are expected to use it often.\r\n\r\nSo my proposition is that this tool should only be modded in. By making it a mod it's clearly not a an intended way to play.The very common counter argument is \"since it's obviously not fun, players won't use it. Put it in and let the players decide\". That's like putting a \"level up\" button in an RPG and saying \"well it's obviously not fun, it skips content, players won't use it, but let them decide\". Yes they will, as soon as they encounter a problem a player will evaluate his options. A tempting \"skip-ahead\" button is irresistible in such situations. \r\n\r\nIt's hard to remove such a powerful tool now, since it's oh-so-tempting to import that nice blueprint book with belt balancers, so you don't have to deal with designing those complex things yourself. Until a different consensus is reached, the tool will stay in game. But I urge players to restrain themselves from adding too many blueprints to their library that are not their own (or their friend's).\r\n\r\n[h1]Combat/Biters[/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]Weapons shouldn't lock on[/h1]\r\nWeapon lock on and the distinction between shooting with spacebar and C is a constant source of confusion for new players. Also, it is just weird and not even fun. Weapons should all work like the shotgun, you point and shoot, and the bullets hit whatever is in that direction. There's only one button to shoot, and that can be spacebar. We could take inspiration from the huge number of top down shooters out there to figure out satisfying weapon mechanics that would work with this new style. Even if you don't like this style, we already have it for some weapons (shotgun), and using it for some weapons but not all is inconsistent and confusing. (Klonan made a [url=https://mods.factorio.com/mod/KS_Combat]mod[/url] a while ago which does something like this).\r\n\r\n[h1]Biters should be more aggressive, and probe your defenses[/h1]\r\nCurrently, you can get by with only walling off part of your base, responding to attacks as they come, and leaving the rest fairly open. This runs opposite to what \"most new players\" [citation needed] would expect. For example, I always started off by walling and turreting my entire base, presuming that if the biters noticed a part of my perimeter that was uncovered, they would just go through there. The counter-argument is that it makes the game less fun, because you spend way too long building massive defensive walls instead of making your factory. My counter to that is that for a lot of people, making defenses is very fun, everyone loves turtling in RTS games. Maybe it's just my play style, but this is what I was doing anyway even when it's not necessary, and leaving big holes in my walls just feel wrong. IMO if you don't enjoy that, you should just turn off biters. Also related is the way that biters will sometimes ignore your structures, if they are not polluting or military. For the same reasons, I think you should have to defend your railway lines, power poles, etc.\r\n\r\n [h1]Clearing bases should not leave you safe[/h1]\r\nRelated to the point above, I think that clearing the bases inside your pollution cloud should provide only a very temporary respite from attacks. Biters should very regularly expand back into your pollution cloud, meaning you always have to defend. Alternatively, the whole pollution cloud mechanic could be removed, and replaced with a worldwide pollution count.\r\n\r\n[h1]Miners shouldn't output directly to belts[/h1]\r\nEvery other interaction between a belt and a building uses an inserter to move the items to/from the belt. Why are miners any different? From a pure consistency point of view, I think this should be removed. As far as I know, the reason it has been left this way so far is just convenience. (Bonus fact: I used to put inserters in front of my miners for an unspecified-but-way-too-long time when I was new to the game).\r\n\r\n[h1]Boilers shouldn't have a water output[/h1]\r\nDuring our in-house testing, one of the things we did was invite people who had never played the game before into the office to try the new introduction campaign, while we observed them. One stumbling block that almost every person hit, was connecting their steam engine to the water output of their boiler, instead of the steam output. I understand that the current setup allows for some interesting layouts, but IMO it is not worth the usability cost.\r\n\r\n[h1]Pipes should work like electricity[/h1]\r\nPipes and fluid have been a constant annoyance for a long time. Thanks to the labours of another of our developers (Dominik), this has improved greatly, and is due to improve even more. However, if I had the choice, I would just remove the headaches outright, by making pipes function like magic liquid teleporters. Each \"pipe network\" (a block of connected pipes) would have a set of inputs and outputs. The load would be drawn equally from all inputs, and distributed equally to all outputs. Of course, this would mean that there would be no flow limits for pipes. So you could, for example, have a massive array of offshore pumps connected via a single pipe to a large nuclear plant, and it would work just fine. There would also be no way to visualise the flow, so the windows would have to be removed. IMO, the cost is worth the gain.\r\n\r\n[h1]Adventure mode[/h1]\r\nI can't get my wife to play Factorio with me because she's not really that into Factory building.But she and I have been playing Satisfactory because it gives herreasons to explore the map and discover new places and collect items.\r\n\r\nThe obvious change that could be made to Factorioto accomodate that play style would be to scatter useful itemsaround the map.I imagine things like an abandoned railyardthat would give one early access to a few prebuilt enginesand rails, totally changing the way an early factory is designed.\r\n\r\nBut there is a second aspect leads to Factorio not being very exploration-driven,and that is that [i]you can see ridiculously far and nothing obstructs your line of sight[/i].Who needs to explore when you can just plop down a few radar towers?Forests would be much more meaningful if you couldn't see through them,and had to actually poke around and through them to know what was there.(I personally take inspiration from [url=https://ultima.fandom.com/wiki/Ultima_III:_Exodus]Ultima 3[/url]for line-of-sight calculations in 2D games).\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of line-of-sight-blocking terrain features, we also need mountains.Not just rows of cliffs, but large and impassiblemountain ranges that compliment the impassible (but non-sight-blocking and land-fillable)bodies of water.\r\n\r\nGames with a first-person perspective automatically give you the line-of-sight effect.Another thing that true 3D game engines give you out of the box that 2D onesusually don't is the possibility of non-planar worlds.Bridges and tunnels can provide alternate (or secret) routes and interesting loops.But it is possible to get some of the same effects out of a 2D engine.Since Factorio already supports multiple surfaces, it wouldn't be too much of a stretchto add a cave system (preferrably with an [url=http://www.nuke24.net/plog/21.html]odd topology[/url]) underneath the surface surface,with entrances in mountain sides.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that making vanilla Factorio more fun for peoplewho want to focus more on exploration is itself controversial,but all these features take time and energy to build and maintain,and \"Factorio isn't supposed to be about exploration\",so it hasn't been a priority.\r\n\r\n[h1]Robots should take up space and time[/h1]\r\nIn my estimation, the main cause of bots becoming[url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-224]overpowered in late-stage factories[/url]is that they take up zero space(large amounts of logistic or construction bots can occupy a single point on the map)and take zero time to pick up or drop items or to deconstruct things.This leads to the following:\r\n[list][*]Laser-turret-creeping enemy bases is trivial because construction bots can  instantaneously place enough turrets to completely overwhelm all the biters.[/*][*]There is no reason to mess with belts at all when bots can 'teleport'  unlimited resources between storage chests.[/*][/list]\r\nBuildings taking time to construct (such as they do in games like Total Annihilation)would to some degree solve the first problem,since an already dug-in force would have a chanceto defend itself while turrets are being built.\r\n\r\nBots taking up space (so that they have to queue up to pick up and drop off items)would solve the problem of bots completely obsoleting belts;to transport large numbers of items quickly you wouldneed to spread out the pickup and load boxesto give the many robots space to work.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we're not doing this is that bot movement logicis currently written such that calculations are needed only when something changes(a robot completes its task, its target is moved, etc).Having to keep bots separated would add a lot more calculationsthat need to be done while a bot is en route,which would probably result in a lot of complaintsfrom people with huge bot-based factoriesthat the game got all slow.\r\n\r\n[h1]Items should have volume and mass[/h1]\r\nSimilar to the overpowerdness-of-bots problem,being able to carry multiple locomotives (or rocket silos)around in a backpack or in a train car feels silly.Big things should require time and space to move around.\r\n\r\nSolving that would require completely changing how construction works—large things would have to be built on-site a la Total Annihilation or Satisfactoryinstead of being preassembled.But that could lead to its own interesting situations.Some objects would require more resources than can fit in a standard stack,so special assembly buildings would be needed.\r\n\r\nThere are mods(such as [url=https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rocket-Silo-Construction]Rocket Silo Construction[/url])that try to do this with certain buildings already.\r\n\r\n[h1]Power-user hotkeys[/h1]\r\nI believe it is alright for a game to have power-user controls that are not bound to any keys by default. For example \"Toggle exoskeleton\" introduced with a 0.17's toolbar is a feature that most people probably will never need, and lot of people won't even realize it exists. It is probably useful for some people, and it also useful that it can be toggled by a hotkey, but it doesn't need to be bound to any keys by default. People just get confused why they run slow when they press the hotkey by accident, even if they knew about the feature, but don't actively consider its existence.\r\n\r\nI think if we changed our attitude towards default keybindings we could go nuts with adding new shortcuts and there would be little bit for everyone. I mean, how many people use hotkeys for connecting or disconnecting trains, and how many people would use a shortcut for toggling manual driving in trains.\r\n\r\n[h1]Mining furnaces and assembling machines should return the ingredients for the in-progress recipe[/h1]\r\nIn Factorio the game makes a large effort to not punish the player for experimenting: you can mine up anything you build and move it somewhere else or just try different setups. The game doesn't punish the player for this (or so most people think). You can hand craft things and if you change your mind just stop crafting to get the ingredients back.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to furnaces and assembling machines this is different. Anything which is in-progress when you mine a furnace or assembling machine is lost. If you had a Kovarex enrichment process running with 40 Uranium 235 and you mine the centrifuge the game deletes all 40 of the Uranium 235 and you're left with nothing.\r\n\r\nIn a previous version of the game it would just give back everything it had consumed when the recipe started. However, because of a possible [b]incredibly[/b] tiny exploit related to productivity modules and being able to get an extra % of items back if you time it correctly this was removed ([url=https://forums.factorio.com/57452]bug report[/url]).\r\n\r\nWe continue to get bug reports about deleted items and all of them get filed under \"not a bug\". There have even been [url=https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Dont_lose_in_progress_ingredients]mods[/url] created to address this specific shortcoming in the game.\r\n\r\nRemember that since we are focusing on 1.0, these ideas are currently nothing more than a cause for heated discussions in our office. But let us know what you think (on our [url=https://forums.factorio.com/74876]forum[/url])  and maybe we will change our mind based on the feedback.

It was nice to have most of the team together to share some beers and pizza.\r\n\r\n[h1]Not stable quite yet[/h1]\r\nUnfortunately a couple of nasty bugs appeared this week, in no small part due to forum member boskid and his crusade to find bugs. In the last month alone boskid has reported over 20 bugs, so very special thanks are due. Saying that, we have been efficient in our fixing, and are now down to 32 open bug reports on the forum.\r\n\r\nWhile there are issues being reported, the number of crashes is at an all time low. Below is a comparison between 0.16 and 0.17. \r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/9f8729a235d5302d93391e1a7efdb2f5ab9cfecf.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWe compared the current number of 0.17 crashes to the number of crashes in 0.16 before we released 0.17. From what we can tell, comparing the number of crashes against average player counts, about two thirds of players are playing on 0.17. Factoring the player counts into the data, we can determine that 0.17 is close to being as stable as 0.16.\r\n\r\nA lot of the crashes are from older 0.17 experimental releases, which might be skewing the data. Additionally about 1 in 20 of the bug reports are due to Cheat Engine, and not something we can fix.\r\n\r\nWhat this means for the stable release, the plan is the same as last week. We have just release 0.17.66 with a bunch of fixes, and if it weathers the weekend player base and nothing critical arises, we will mark it as stable next week.\r\n\r\n[h1]Community spotlight - Nauvis Post Collapse[/h1]\r\nForum member lilstrip has spent over 8 months working on a map, based on the idea of an Abandoned Colony/City, first talking about his baby in [url=https://forums.factorio.com/63668]this thread[/url].

We will continue to fix bugs and issues after the stable, and we will also start our work on the features of the 'next stable', so the GUI improvements and all the rest we have mentioned in the past.\r\n\r\nIn the next few weeks a lot of the team is going to be on vacation, so things won't get up and running with the new feature work for a while. This experimental period has been quite a long one, we had a lot of new things to fix and debug, and a lot of technical debt from the year of development. There won't be another release quite so large, we only have a few major things left to cross off the list before we can call Factorio finished:[list][*]All new GUI's implemented.[*]New Campaign and mini-tutorials.[*]Completed high-res graphics.[*]Maybe some small surprises along the way.[/list]By no means are any of these easy, but each day brings us closer to concluding this chapter of Factorio history.\r\n\r\n[h1]Prototype documentation overhaul[/h1]\r\nJust in time for the stable version, the [url=https://wiki.factorio.com/Prototype_definitions]prototype documentation[/url] for mods has received a major overhaul.

Furthermore, each prototype page now provides a compact overview of not only its own properties and their types, but also the properties it inherits from other prototypes. The documentation also boasts a new [url=https://wiki.factorio.com/Prototype_overview]overview page[/url] that lists all 199 prototypes and their 1943 fields.\r\n\r\nAs always, let us know what you think on our [url=https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=74343]forum[/url].\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1565360132,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":427520},{"gid":"2412159905943847476","title":"Version 0.17.63 released","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2412159905943847476","is_external_url":true,"author":"wheybags","contents":"[h1][b]Changes[/b][/h1]\r\n  [list]\r\n    [*]Inventory filters tooltip now shows they are inventory filters to avoid confusion.

You may want to read previous FFFs ([url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-257]FFF-257[/url], [url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-284#production]FFF-284[/url]) about the Introduction.\r\n\r\n[i]TLDR: the Stable candidate of the Introduction scenario is now in Experimental please play it and send me your screenshots. Feedback especially on the “freeform endgame” would be greatly appreciated. We have also released a Experimental version of the Demo, be sure to send [url=https://factorio.com/download-demo/experimental]this link[/url] to your friends ASAP[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]SPOILER WARNING: If you have not yet played the Introduction Scenario, go play it before you read this.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Introduction scenario as Tutorial[/h1]\r\nThe tutorial components of the Introduction are working very well now. There is still more polish to do, but I feel confident it is ready for new players of all kinds.\r\n\r\n[h1]Introduction scenario as Demo[/h1]\r\nThe rest of this article will discuss the Introduction, but from the point of view of a player who has not payed for the game yet. Once 0.17 Stable comes out, the Free Demo will be replaced with just the Introduction Scenario.\r\n[h1]What we wanted from a new version of the Demo[/h1]\r\nThe old demo has a very limited amount of content, and only about 2 hours of playtime. The content it does present is very dated, and hardly could be called representative of contemporary Freeplay Factorio, it did not even include Research!\r\n\r\nWe had some design constraints for the new demo, some of which were:[list][*]The player can fail during the demo[*]Difficulty is respectful, Fake danger is disrespectful[/list]\r\n\r\nWhatever happened, we hoped that the new demo would demonstrate a wider range of Factorios concepts, including a small taste of deathworld difficulty. I would say we were too successful.\r\n\r\nWe decided to do this with a final quest where the player has to quickly complete a long research while the biter attacks increase in strength. The player needs to be completely attentive, otherwise their defense will fall over. \r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/29018da72a38e8e7834281915d0c6f814d059fb4.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAn invisible, dynamic difficulty curve meant that everyone was challenged to the breaking point, veterans and new players alike. See [url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-284#production]FFF-284[/url]. For the goal of being a challenge, I would say it was working well.\r\n[h1]What other people were thinking[/h1]\r\nPeople loved it or hated it. I received many elated emails saying how intense the final battle was and how sweet the victory felt. I also received pseudo-hatemail about 1,000 hour players rage quitting.\r\n\r\nThe reason a lot of vets were failing was because they were pretending to be new players. This generally meant playing as a vet (using shortcut keys, and high APM, heavy pollution) but placing few turrets, generally in sub-optimal locations, and being lazy with ammunition delivery.\r\n\r\nNewer players felt pressured and were generally able to pull off a close victory. Many said they were overrun at the end, but still were victorious, giving an interesting moment to leave the game and start freeplay with a high heartrate.\r\n\r\nFeedback was far more positive than negative, but from the negative feedback there were two recurring themes.[list][*]The most common negative feedback was that such intense combat is not representative of Factorio.[*]The second most common feedback was that the player did not expect such a difficulty in a 'tutorial' level.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Failed Solution 1: Sending less biters[/h1]\r\nThis removes the chance that the player can lose, but introduces new problems with the design. It removes ammunition as a production pressure, and makes Turret placement irrelevant.\r\n[h1]Failed Solution 2: Ramp up the attacks slower[/h1]\r\nThis sounds like it could work and for the second problem listed above, it does. The player has more time to react. However this means that only new players experience the challenge, as they most likely have built the fewest Labs, and take the longest to finish the quest. Vets will finish before the attacks built up to any meaningful level. Just making it easier for the players who are able to overcome the challenge the most seems odd.\r\n\r\n[h1]Failed Solution 3: Add more time between waves[/h1]\r\nIn order to have a decent number of biters so the production challenge is not lost, the waves need to be very large. For the player to have enough notice between waves, there is a chance they will be able to finish the research before the first one comes. Also the most common failure state was when a Turret with 200 rounds is destroyed, meaning the player cannot craft enough new ammo to keep up with the waves. This happens more often with bigger, less frequent waves.\r\n\r\nAll three of these solutions have one thing in common: we would need to implement them in a way that removed the challenge almost completely. So I suggested an alternative solution.\r\n\r\n[h1]New Solution: Remove the Challenge quest completely[/h1]\r\nNow there is no timed research and defence quest at the end of the Introduction. Instead the player is told to destroy Biter spawners to reduce the attack frequency, and then they are left to deal with Freeplay style attacks. The structure of the final quest is similar to Freeplay itself \"Research a technology at the bottom of the tech tree\". The player now needs to automate Logistic Science packs to win the Introduction.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/91f1fb411a3b3ef5a12a14dc807d1ff496a0e02f.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIf the player cannot survive here, they will not survive a Freeplay game, but realistically the biter challenge in Default settings Freeplay is not particularly worrisome.\r\n\r\n[h1]Other new Demo goodies[/h1]\r\nHaving a great Demo is important to us. We don’t want someone to pay for the game, just to see if they like it. It is also fits well with our no sales policy. We already offer an extended refund period to players who buy on our website, if they gave the game a red-hot go but discovered it was not for them.\r\n\r\nDemos are in general a super cool thing from the 90’s that most people here wish still existed.\r\n\r\nSo we will increase the amount of content in the demo. You can continue playing at the end of the Introduction, and I suspect there is about 10 hours of stuff to do. We are also adding more recipes and technologies to the Demo.\r\n\r\nThe new list of what is available:\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/256239ab9201bafca937c342d6dd7df584eb2519.png[/img]\r\n\r\nA complete and unique demo techtree that uses Automation and Logistics science packs, Mining Productivity infinite tech, Shooting speed infinite tech, Grenades, Steel, Piercing rounds, Car, Medium power poles, Heavy armor, Submachine gun, Assembling machine 2, Turrets, Lamps, Long handed inserters, Gates, Walls, and more to discover.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/3c8119fd60be311876cfcde923f345dbfd48ae85.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThe size of the final play area is also much larger.\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/6b15a28da90e04242d872d1ad19cdfae8e4a2fcf.png][img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/6b15a28da90e04242d872d1ad19cdfae8e4a2fcf.png[/img][/url]\r\n[i]Click to view full size[/i]\r\n\r\nWe have released the changes today, and also released an experimental version of the demo.

They allow scenarios and mods to add GUIs that look and feel like the base game.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/0c947bdd0d4c030cf2af87197866c3893daad7ba.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWhen someone new to Factorio modding is introduced to how they function, they almost always have the same questions:[list][*]Why is mod GUI part of the game state?[*]Why do mod GUIs need to be deterministic?[*]How can I edit the base game GUIs?[/list]\r\n\r\nAnd then comes the explanation:[list]The actual widgets are not part of the game state and are not deterministic. The part that mods have access to however is. In an environment where mods have to operate deterministically, if a mod is allowed to read some data that data must be deterministic. In that simple bit of logic; if a mod can read the checked state of a checkbox then that checked state needs to be deterministic. If the mod didn't have access to read that state it would need to store the last-known state and update it every time it got the changed event.[/list]\r\n\r\nTry to imagine that: every single mod implementing their own system for remembering last-known-state about GUIs they're using. Instead of leaving that entire mess to mod developers we decided long ago that we would manage that \"last-known-state\" for them. The basic data about what a given mod wanted to show on screen is recorded so mods can read and change it as they want and not need to be concerned with constantly updating it every time some changed event happens. Additionally it means that the game can use that \"last known state\" to restore what the player sees if they save, quit, and load the game.\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the last question: \"How can I edit the base game GUIs?\". Using the above example it's much easier to explain that: as a mod - you can't. The base game GUIs are not implemented using this same system - they're just pure collections of widgets. None of the \"last known state\" is saved anywhere and it's all lost when saving, quitting, and loading.\r\n\r\nHowever, that leaves a divide: we need to implement each widget type through the \"CustomGui\" system in order for mods to be able to use them. With this latest release I finally figured out a way to do tabbed panes since they're special in how they work compared to everything else. Additionally I figured out a semi-friendly way for mods to put things directly on the screen in a way that the player can drag them around - instead of being limited to some fixed area (left, top, center, etc).\r\n\r\nAnother system which I've been thinking about for quite some time is some way for mods to position GUI elements relative to base game GUIs. For example: a mod wants to add a pane which shows on the left of the character inventory GUI. Currently it's not possible - the base game GUI isn't readable by mods so they can't do anything with it. My idea is some system where a mod can say \"I want to add this GUI, and I want it to be shown relative to [i]the character GUI[/i] on the left side\" and then any time the character GUI is shown it would also show the mod GUI.\r\n\r\nThere are some critical parts to this new system. It needs to:[list][*]Be easy to expand (either automatically works with all new base game GUIs or works with minimal effort).[*]Not break with simple refactoring.[*]Not cause other programmers trouble by existing.[*]Not prevent base game GUIs from working how they need to work.[/list]So far none of it seems impossible. I don't know when I'll have it working, but I'm looking forward to what mods will do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]The Oil Changes[/h1]\r\nIn the last [url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-304]FFF[/url], we presented changes to how Basic oil processing works along with some other changes (mainly moving Worker robots behind Chemical science pack), which resulted in a lot of discussion as it is a very sensitive topic.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed with as many of you as we could, and in this FFF we would like to present to you what conclusions we came to, and try to explain our ideas in more detail.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/4d69d569b64e97fc5cc0d736a3eaf3c8fb29af42.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]Basic oil processing changes[/h1]\r\nA significant portion of you has voiced concerns about removing Light and Heavy oil from the outputs of Basic oil processing, be it about the change itself, or that it does not fit because of some other factors...\r\n\r\nAutomating Chemical science packs is generally considered to be a huge step by many, mostly because even for veteran players, setting up oil processing consists of many steps, and for newer players there’s many new things to learn very quickly. This change is trying to address both of these issues.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/fff418e4bc34e80f892adb5cf3ce760b01e96151.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAs for the complexity, the most confusing factor is the specific mechanic of the Oil refinery, that all products need to be used or stored in order to keep it working. This is made worse by the common situation that the player can be very far ahead with what they have unlocked with technologies, while being very far behind with what they have already automated.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/589f65570a5d832b919590558ba93a7d87420c65.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThis can lead to a new player having every Logistic science technology researched before setting up the refinery, and just the sheer number of new unknown items and recipes can get very confusing, especially when some are not really useful at the moment.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/8a5ccc46ffaa08c1a5e79248c788dc85dc3ff262.png[/img]\r\n\r\nOne of the ways we can look at the Chemical science pack is \"the proof that the player has managed to set up a functional refinery\". With this in mind, it fits very well to have them set up a rather basic refinery, and get to know most of the new entities/items/recipes that are necessary to progress, first.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/9f4acccab3ab9974c88b5dce6d6340ad7f84f5d3.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAfter 'proving' that Basic oil processing is working, the player can proceed to a more advanced version with more outputs and more recipes - but as the player is already familiar with the basics and has their infrastructure already in place (Pumpjacks, oil transport, how pipes work, Chemical plants, ...), it’s not nearly as confusing and daunting to unlock and orient themselves in the Advanced oil processing, yet it still has new concepts to grasp (multiple outputs, cracking, more recipes).\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/2f70fa31aebbfb982082e7ec033c2e0a99bc8861.png[/img]\r\n\r\nA lot of people have voiced their concern about simplifying the game, but setting up Advanced oil processing (or Coal liquefaction which also has the same challenge of multiple outputs and using cracking) is still mandatory in order to launch the rocket. The learning curve is just smoother.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/be4329c328759544d481256968f685409c948604.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAll in all, we would like to keep this change as we believe it has a positive impact on the game both for newer and veteran players, however when discussing the changes, we realized there are things that would make this change fit in the game much better...\r\n\r\n[h1]The use of Light oil[/h1]\r\nMany of you pointed out that Light oil has very few uses in the game - mainly producing Solid fuel efficiently, but it’s possible to ignore Light oil altogether and just produce Solid fuel from Petroleum gas, sacrificing some Crude oil efficiency for simplicity.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/7f5bac8b72f3889e622950c1f3bdce4e76d97a67.png[/img]\r\n\r\nOne of the topics repeated many times was that with the proposed changes, suddenly the player is incapable of producing Solid fuel \"the right way\" (from Light oil) from the start. While this alone is not a big problem and can be justified by \"at least the player will appreciate Advanced oil processing more\", the efficiency of Solid fuel from Light oil is fairly unobvious, and the player has so many more critical problems to focus on that it’s easy to miss.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/df895781bd0a1ebcdf09d3f09c308d56c55b8502.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]Rocket fuel behind chemical science pack, requires light oil[/h1]\r\nWe are adding Light oil to the Rocket fuel recipe, and therefore moving Rocket fuel behind Advanced oil processing, with Rocketry taking the pre-requisite of Flammables instead. This should help as a slight hint to produce Solid fuel out of Light oil and to make the recipe a little more interesting - we don’t have many assembling machine recipes with fluid input and a refinery-related fuel recipe is a good fit. One of the obscure details was that the only motivation that made Advanced oil processing mandatory was just Lubricant - which does not feel like a high-tech product - now there is Rocket fuel as well.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/a0eb707e1d0fa46a6c8b4507f5077e744db0c993.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThe more important question many of you have asked would be \"why even make Solid fuel with the changes\". This applies even more now that Rocket fuel is behind Advanced oil processing.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/49598496b3b72cd9a8690141e2c51a0f1049973f.png[/img]\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about the idea of adding Solid fuel to a science pack was that it could be created from the excess Light oil that the player has no use for until unlocking Advanced oil processing. Then it could easily be burned to get rid of it to keep the refinery working, but since Basic oil processing has no excess byproducts anymore, every bit of Petroleum gas is valuable - therefore producing Solid fuel feels like a waste, unless the player has a desperate lack of coal to burn.\r\n[h1]Chemical science pack change - Sulfur[/h1]\r\nThere is however an item that is much more useful than Solid fuel, and is also created from Petroleum gas - Sulfur.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/62e12f492cc8ac06602e4dabd527d6fc8e893d13.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIt opens the path towards Sulfuric acid (for Batteries both for Modular armor and for Accumulators), and more interestingly Explosives. Unlocking the Rocket launcher often feels like a big side step mainly because it requires setting up Explosives production. With Sulfur set up for the science pack, this is one step more convenient. A similar case occurs with Tank and Cannon shells later.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/675f38fb361dadee23fb988345fdf980b51177ef.png[/img]\r\n\r\nTherefore we find it fitting to replace Solid fuel with Sulfur in the Chemical science pack recipe, as there are multiple uses for it even with Logistic and Military science packs, and Solid fuel has lost a lot of its charm with the new changes.\r\n\r\n[h1]Robots behind chemical science pack[/h1]\r\nOne of the obviously controversial changes from the last FFF, was that Worker robots would become gated behind Chemical science pack. Our thought process behind this change was that you need to set up pretty much all of the oil refining recipes anyway, so it is not as much of a big jump as it seems.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we believe it has been a confusing trap - it has appeared as a Logistic science pack tier technology, but in reality requires all the items that the next technological tier would expect you to have. On top of that, worker robots are a good motivation and reward for unlocking Chemical science pack which does not have that many big shiny technologies behind it.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/fa6fb200a960b4a92b2bd89df83c5c620a99c07f.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWith the change of putting Sulfur into the Chemical science pack recipe, worker robots are even closer to it as all the items in the science pack directly contribute to getting robots.\r\n\r\n[h1]Flamethrower ammo change - Crude oil[/h1]\r\nWith Heavy and Light oil behind Chemical science pack, Flamethrower ammo needed to be moved as well or have its recipe changed. Rather hastily we chose to change the recipe for Petroleum gas instead of the oils which does not make much sense, especially as the Flamethrower turret can’t take Petroleum gas. After some of you pointed this out, it shall be Crude oil instead. Technically you can already use the turret with Crude oil barrels on the offensive, so making Flamethrower ammo simpler is not a problem.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/bda2670b5edda530ca4ff0191117f5e54fb7c369.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]Adjusting the numbers[/h1]\r\nWe made slight changes to the numbers in the recipes - specifically, Basic oil processing results in a bit more Petroleum gas (45 instead of 40), and Advanced oil processing results in more Heavy oil (25 instead of 10) than before. This is because it was common to use Basic oil processing over Advanced oil processing when you needed a lot of lubricant for Express transport belts.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/1872486e6f240994bfa1f5a54f3eb5ba4343f5a8.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWe are confident about these changes but nothing is set in stone, so let us know what you think about them. We actually found a bug with the new 'block water input fluidbox' feature we added, so we won't release the changes until we have that sorted. You can test these changes (except the reserved fluid inputs) with [url=https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Oil-Changes]this mod[/url]. \r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1564149652,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":427520},{"gid":"3364670677178608561","title":"Version 0.17.59 released","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/3364670677178608561","is_external_url":true,"author":"posila87","contents":"[h1][b]Balancing[/b][/h1]\r\n [list]\r\n   [*]Changed expensive variant of electronic circuit to require 8 copper cables instead of 10.\r\n [/list]\r\n[h1][b]Changes[/b][/h1]\r\n [list]\r\n   [*]User verification must be enabled for public multiplayer games.

The last bugs are often the ones we have been putting off for a reason, they generally require some more meaningful changes and decisions. That is why this week we have a lot to discuss.\r\n\r\n[h1]G2A update[/h1]\r\nG2A got back to us this Monday, nothing much has happened so I will keep it short. They asked if we would agree to an audit to verify the money lost to chargebacks, we said yes, and they said they will start contacting some audit companies, and that it will 'take some time'.\r\n\r\n[h1]Rail-planner obstacle avoidance[/h1]\r\nKovarex was convinced by members of the forum to add someway to use the obstacle avoidance mode of the rail planner. Now when planning a rail path, holding CTRL will make it use the obstacle avoidance ghost planning.\r\n\r\n[h1]MP server description[/h1]\r\nDear server owners: the server description field is being enlarged from 120 to 5000 characters, and it now loads immediately. As soon as the next release is out, you may stop abusing the \"tags\" field for your colorful descriptions.\r\n\r\n[h1]Oil processing changes[/h1]\r\nWe decided to change the Basic oil processing recipe so that now it only outputs petroleum gas.\r\n\r\nNormally this recipe change would mean all 3 outputs would be petroleum gas, but we added a new feature so that a recipe can specify a specific fluidbox to use. We also used the same system so the future water input (for advanced oil processing) is closed.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/a5238625a30895485ceed02079dff409ebd363a6.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWe believe this contributes to make oil a bit less of a difficulty spike, and also means we no longer need to remember which side the water goes in.\r\n\r\nThis means that light and heavy oil is only available after Advanced oil processing is researched. The biggest issue this introduces is that worker robots require lubricant made from heavy oil.\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/86a203b2ad8ef29c0b21a9848ec1e21cfa9f904d.png][img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/f5ba792cb84506305b1ebcdaf5c05bf216566f4d.png[/img][/url]\r\n[i]Click to see more technologies.[/i]\r\n\r\nThe solution we chose to apply is to move worker robots behind chemical science pack. This change does delay how quickly you are able to get worker robots, but the difference should not be too drastic as in order to get robots operational you already need to set up a complete refinery, advanced circuits and 2 upgrades of engines - which is already most of the science pack done.\r\n\r\nBasic oil processing now produces 25% more petroleum gas to offset the loss of light and heavy oil for solid fuel.\r\n\r\nTechnologies which newly received chemical science pack now require less science packs to research them so the total resource price is not too far off either.\r\n\r\nWe prefer to keep flamethrower as it is, but flamethrower ammo now requires petroleum gas instead of light and heavy oil.\r\n\r\n[h1]Laser turret moved to chemical science[/h1]\r\nFor a long time we have felt that there aren’t really enough useful technologies unlocked by chemical science, and laser turrets are a big game changer so we’re moving those to chemical science pack along with the worker robots.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/2ae4a1a031a32ad85f755c4223959e947b8dc930.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]Laser turret shooting speed fixed[/h1]\r\nThere was a [url=https://forums.factorio.com/72360]bug[/url] with laser turrets, the shooting speed upgrade didn't actually increase their firing rate since we switched them to use beams. Posila fixed it, so that more turret shooting speed actually results in more damage per second, not just for laser turrets but for personal laser defense too.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/6a691828e400ce1fedb3c420d33cce13d04c5021.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNow that the shooting speed bonus works properly, we decreased the base shooting speed of the laser turret and personal laser defense by 50%, and with all the upgrades the shooting speed will be 160% of what it used to be.\r\n\r\nAnother result of this bugfix, we decided to change the initial damage of the personal laser defense from 40 to 30. However with full shooting speed technologies the DPS is much higher (at the cost of more energy).\r\n\r\n[h1]Laser beam glow[/h1]\r\nAfter fixing that laser beams didn't glow in dark, OwnlyMe releases a \"Glowing Laser beams\" mod that makes laser beams illuminate ground under them. Vaclav requested this to be base game feature, but there was a catch: Beam graphics didn't tile properly.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/e5834951697dc56110ce930fa735c275723f8634.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWe were aware of issues with tiling of beam graphics ever since we added laser beams, but Vaclav was able to workaround the problem by decreasing intensity of a glow on sprite edged and make the overlapping almost invisible. Almost.\r\n\r\nVaclav tried to workaround the tiling problem by adjusting edges of sprites again, but it quickly turned out it was not possible to do.\r\n\r\nAfter going through code that draws beams I realized that we calculate the exact position of each beam tile, but then pass it to drawing functions which convert the position to MapPosition, which uses fixed-point coordinates with only 8 bits for fractional part. Because of this, the tiles didn't align properly and they sometimes created a gap or overlapped. To cover gaps, the sprites were drawn scaled up by 1%, which resulted in them overlapping even more. Originally, when electric beam was made back in 2015, this did not create any visible issues.\r\n\r\nSo fixing the accidental rounding of rendering position was easy, and the body of the beam started to tile properly, but there were still visible seams at the head and tail of the beam. I was reading up on how triangle rasterization works on GPUs, so I figured that it must be due to head and tail sprites having different sizes than body sprites, so they don't share an edge exactly, which causes some pixels on the edge to be rasterized by both quads and some by neither quads. After spending some time on fixing this problem I found out that the problem was not in rasterization of edges, it was caused by texture filtering.\r\n\r\nThe head and tile sprites that I was using to test the issues were larger than they should have been, and were overlapping the body sprites. Lights are almost always gradients spanning over large area and are rendered using bilinear filtering. So the edge of body tile was aliased because that's where quad ended, but edge of head sprite was bilinearly filtered, because that's where the edge was drawn in the sprite, not the actual edge of the sprite quad. So I changed how the head and tail sprites are drawn, in order for them to always share an edge with body sprites, and that fixed the issue. As a bonus, we were able to turn on trilinear filtering on beam sprites, we didn't use it on them before because it used to make tiling issues even worse.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/c2164a0016015e9b1281a36f69233325c751f5cb.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNow the beams and the glow are as close to pixel perfect as we can get them. The glow really does make the scenes look that much nicer.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/2fc977f10634fe949e7397e01dae8d457ebcf85b.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]Inserters getting stuck[/h1]\r\nI did some improvements to Inserters during some releases of 0.17. I made them faster by removing what I thought were pointless pauses where the Inserter would do nothing for 1 tick in some situations. But after 0.17.50, this started happening:\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/dcbfb4f1838487ba71c1323edca4e43a090d5400.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nIn some specific situation, the Inserter would aim for an item coming towards it, but because the item was too fast, it would overshoot the inserter head. If this is timed in a certain way, it would happen indefinitely. Before 0.17.50 this didn't happen because the Inserter would pause for 1 tick after failing to pick up an item, breaking any timing loops, but it also meant that an Inserter would potentially wait up to 10 ticks during one swing (since the Inserter tracks items on moving belts throughout it's entire movement). \r\n\r\nSo I didn't want to revert back to the previous logic. Many more complex solutions were not very feasible either since Belt<->Inserter interaction is a performance critical part of Factorio. So the final solution was to pause for 1 tick after failing to pick up an item, but only if the Inserter head is on top of a belt. This is should be the best compromise all things considered.\r\n\r\nWe plan to do a release on Monday, so you will have a chance this weekend to share your thoughts regarding any of these changes over on our [url=https://forums.factorio.com/73443]forum[/url].\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1563554749,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":427520},{"gid":"2436927798963592656","title":"Version 0.17.57","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2436927798963592656","is_external_url":true,"author":"wheybags","contents":"[h1][b]Changes[/b][/h1]\r\n  [list]\r\n    [*]Restored ore placement to match that of 0.17.50 [url=https://forums.factorio.com/72487]more[/url]\r\n  [/list]\r\n[h1][b]Optimisations[/b][/h1]\r\n  [list]\r\n    [*]Optimized synchronization time of blueprint library to a new game map.

I don't think in the history of Factorio the bug forum has been so clean. No doubt once we mark 0.17 as stable the count will shoot up again.\r\n\r\nFor this weeks graph I added the count of players on Steam as the left axis. We thought it would be somewhat interesting to see if there is any correlation between the two.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/dbbe1375c158af6536e14e78766f7a0703902dd2.png[/img]\r\n[i]Note: The axis have different scales.[/i]\r\n\r\nI also prepared the same graph but for the duration of the 0.17 release. You can see our player numbers are dropping quite a lot, from the all time peak of 22,457 on the 3rd of March 2019.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/c0326f8d7d106c5e91f2f46ab50fa2e6f63f1eb8.png[/img]\r\n\r\nWhile bug reports might be at an all time low, we are not going to call the game stable yet. We still have an important milestone to reach, that is, implementing the new Introduction campaign graphics ([url=https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-301]FFF-301[/url]). A lot of the team has been on vacation these last few weeks, including the whole campaign team and most of the art department. What this means is that we expect it will be a few more weeks before we can call the current version stable.\r\n\r\nWe have been asked a few times when stable will be released, but my question is, why does it matter exactly which version we call stable? Are you waiting for stable to play a new playthrough? The thing is, this stable is only going to be the 'first' stable. Our plan is to have a number of short experimental phases after the first stable, where we will add new GUI's and such, which will add bugs and technical debt. After fixing the bugs in a 'small' experimental content release, we will then mark that as the 'new' 0.17 stable.\r\n\r\nBesides, there are still a few edge cases with signals that kovarex is busy fixing:\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/c39cff3ff6f690eb19ce8e41fb17c278d21ee68f.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFor instance the setup above took him 3 hours to fix. The cause of the issue was that the segment has both an incoming and outgoing signal at the same position.\r\n\r\n[h1]G2A - Worse than Piracy[/h1]\r\nThere was recently some news about G2A, prompted by [url=https://twitter.com/RaveofRavendale/status/1144971664855371777]a tweet[/url] by Mike Rose of [url=http://nomorerobots.io]No More Robots[/url]. In a follow up tweet he said: [i]Please, if you’re going to buy a game from G2A, just pirate it instead! Genuinely![/i]. \r\n\r\nWe have talked about the grey market resellers in some previous Friday Facts ([url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-145]FFF-145[/url] and [url=https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-171]FFF-171[/url]), and our stance is pretty much the same as Mike, we would rather you pirate Factorio.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the news of G2A advertising [url=https://www.descendersgame.com/]Descenders[/url], we took a look ourselves, and we discovered they were doing the same with Factorio:\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/02ca1de8ec2d915437f990c1fd77f6fe8e602f91.png[/img]\r\n\r\nObviously we aren't super happy about it, but after looking into some trademark/copyright law, it seems there is not much we can do.\r\n\r\nAfter the news broke, G2A posted an article on their website: [url=https://www.g2a.com/news/latest/g2a-vows-to-pay-devs-10x-the-money-proven-to-be-lost-on-chargebacks/]G2A vows to pay devs 10x the money proven to be lost on chargebacks[/url]. After reading it through, I thought I would take them up on their offer.\r\n\r\nWe had a ton of chargeback and fraud issues in 2016 just after our Steam launch, with over 300 Steam keys of the game being purchased with stolen credit cards. With an average chargeback fee of about $20, we estimate the total amount of fees we paid because of chargebacks is about $6,600. We will be doing a deeper evaluation of our historic accounting records to get a more exact figure, but it doesn't matter so much now. \r\n\r\nSo I emailed G2A about the article and their 'vow' last week, and they are not exactly prompt in terms of dealing with the request. I have a list of all the Steam keys I had to revoke because they were purchased fraudulently, and G2A offered to check the keys. Currently this is where the story ends, they haven't replied to my last email (2 days ago) sending them the keys and asking how many of them were sold on the website.\r\n\r\nFunnily, we already know that at least [i]some[/i] of the keys were sold on G2A, because after I revoked them, I had people emailing to ask what was wrong with their key:\r\n[list][*][i]Hello, on 2016-12-26 I bought my brother a Factorio steam cd key from G2A website. On 2017-01-20 he got a message on steam that the game was revoked. What happened and how can we solve this issue?[/i][*][i]Hey, I got this game from my friend on my birthday a while back, March 11thish. He sent me it by key, I didn’t really question it. Yesterday, though, I was greeted by a popup telling me the game had been removed. After investigating, I learned my friend bought it from a site called G2A, little shady site from what I hear. Steam support says it was “revoked at the request of the publisher.” [/i][*][i]I bought Factorio on G2A last week for Steam. However, I can't find it in my Steam library anymore.[/i][*][i]On 3 March I bought the game Factorio on G2a It was 5 euro cheaper than on your website so I thought let's buy it here. But today I got a pop-up from steam saying that my Factorio steamkey has been revoked because of a problem with processing payment for this item.[/i][*][i]Today i logged in, after playing this game rougly 300 hours and about 2 month and got a message that Factorio was removed from my account. I got my key from G2A.[/i][*][i]I bought Factorio on steam a while back and when i went to play it, it said i had to purchase it. I contacted steam and they said that it had been revoked and i should contact the publisher. How and  will i get the game back? I bought the game off of G2A.[/i][*][i]I bought the game on g2a and got the steam product code and my account is saying that I don't have the game bought.[/i][/list]\r\nWell anyway, after we switched payment providers to [url=https://www.humblebundle.com/developer/widget]Humble Widget[/url], the fraudulent purchases stopped. We don't really care about G2A anymore (but we are in a unique position due to our no sales policy).\r\n\r\nThere are still Steam gifts of Factorio being sold on G2A, these are most likely 'legit', in that they were not purchased using stolen credit cards. The question is, where do these gifts come from? Obviously people would not be selling Factorio Steam gifts if it did not generate a profit. We have some ideas:\r\n[list][*][b]Regional fraud[/b] - Buying the game in 1 country and gifting it to someone in another. This is likely, as we can see that the Europe gift is cheaper than the US/Worldwide.\r\n[img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/12002589/4c8cf0803452c0f22b585a8c9bb23f87b1b08c58.png[/img]\r\n[*][b]Speculative buyers from before the price increase[/b] - The price of the game was $20 a year ago. So buying 1,000 copies and waiting 1 year, nets you a profit of $5,000 if you sell for $25. Not a bad gain in a year. For Factorio the opportunity only came once, but other games go on sale multiple times each year, which is where the speculative buyers and the grey market cash-in.[/list]\r\nTo conclude this whole topic, we strongly recommend people buy from us or one of our official partners. Not only for the reasons you might think. If you buy from a grey-market site and have a problem with the game, or something goes wrong, you will have to deal with their support system. I don't have the exact details of how to request a refund or customer support from G2A, or how long they will take to respond to your issue.\r\n\r\nIf you buy from us directly, we offer a 28-day refund policy. If you have a problem with the game, you decide it's not your cup of tea, you thought the biters were too cute, just send us an email and you will have a refund in short order. We also deal only with Factorio related support problems, we don't process orders of thousands of different games, so you can be sure your case will be handled expediently by team members who know the game in and out.\r\n\r\nAs always, let us know what you think on our [url=https://forums.factorio.com/73190]forum[/url].\r\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1562944500,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":427520},{"gid":"2436927798949358501","title":"Version 0.17.56 released","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2436927798949358501","is_external_url":true,"author":"posila87","contents":"[h1][b]Minor Features[/b][/h1]\r\n [list]\r\n   [*]Added option to enable Steam Cloud Sync for blueprint library to Other Settings GUI.
