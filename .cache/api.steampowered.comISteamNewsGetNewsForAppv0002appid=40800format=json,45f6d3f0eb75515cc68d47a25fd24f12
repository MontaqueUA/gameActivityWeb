The scope of it was going to be very small,    the programmer of Team Meat told me at PAX East 2019 last weekend.    The idea was just to be like a palette cleanser in between our bigger projects because we were working on <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/mew-genics/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mew-Genics</a>.

It   s still an auto-runner, but if you   re worried about Forever being dumbed down after beginning life on mobile, rest assured that it looks and feels just like the 2010 mega hit     right down to the speed of Meat Boy   s stubby red legs. </p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/04/05/team-meat-on-the-return-of-super-meat-boy/#more-667439\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Team Meat on the return of Super Meat Boy\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n","feedlabel":"Rock, Paper, Shotgun","date":1554480022,"feedname":"rps","feed_type":0,"appid":40800},{"gid":"2417769111330651111","title":"Super Meat Boy free for keepsies on Epic Games Store","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2417769111330651111","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Alice O'Connor)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/01/super-meat-boy.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/01/super-meat-boy.jpg/RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>Splendidly deadly platformer <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/super-meat-boy/\">Super Meat Boy</a> is free to keep on the Epic Games Store if you grab it now.

Now, more details have come to light at PAX: details like it's \"not an endless runner\", and lots of other interesting stuff. Also the sad news that Mew-Genics   Team Meat's cat-based cat game about cats   is now on hold.<br />\n<br />\nAs an FAQ at the above link explains, Super Meat Boy Forever is \"not a simple endless runner\" and \"not a one button game\", but rather a meaty platformer featuring six chapters, a dark world, twice the bosses of Super Meat Boy, and \"a vast randomly generated level structure\" that will change the level layout after each death. There will be an endless mode, and Meat Boy will scamper along levels without you having to hold down an analog stick/d-pad, but the platforming does seem a bit more embellished than that in most endless running type games.<br />\n<br />\nTeam Meat's \"goal with SMB:F is to design a new full length platformer for touch devices from the ground up to avoid tacking bad controls on an existing design. we want to make something that embodies the original Super Meat Boy but is designed around a simple yet intuitive control scheme allowing for pin point accuracy and surprisingly deep controls without the use of multiple buttons/analog sticks.\" Don't let that \"touch devices\" bit worry you: it's also coming to PC.<br />\n<br />\nAs for Team Meat's other in-development game, \"Mewgenics is not canceled, we just put it on hold to work full time on this one. Once SMB:F is released we will hop back on it\".<br />\n<br />\nSuper Meat Boy Forever looks like this:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1409500800,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":40800},{"gid":"552009088170101967","title":"Team Meat s Live Action Stealth: A Voyeur For September","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/552009088170101967","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Graham Smith)","contents":"<p><img src=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/14/aug/voyeurforseptember.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Team Meat, makers of <a href=\"http://supermeatboy.com/\">Super Meat Boy</a>, have announced their intent to become an indie game developer.

You can ask me what it is, but I will tell you only this: It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside a trailer.<br />\n<br />\nDo you ever get the feeling that Team Meat has a little trouble staying focused? Back in October 2012, Edmund McMillen announced that the new version of Super Meat Boy the team was working on was being put on hold so it could focus on Mew-Genics, and then last month he revealed that Mew-Genics had also been put on hold so he and Team Meat partner Tommy Refenes can work on something entirely different.<br />\n<br />\nThat \"something\" has now come to light, sort of, as A Voyeur For September. All it is at this point is a snowy, distorted trailer consisting primarily of a creeper's view of somebody's living room, intercut with random, black-and-white clips of stuff. There's a website at avoyeurforseptember.com but it consists of nothing but a title, a copyright message, the Team Meat logo and the trailer in question.<br />\n<br />\nIn a post that went up earlier this afternoon, McMillen confirmed that Mew-Genics is \"on hold till the next Team Meat game comes out,\" and said that it will be officially announced and shown later this month at PAX. So with nothing else to do until then, let's take a closer look:<br />\n<br />\nDandelions on the lawn. Men in ties. An empty room, through a window. Plants, and a man at a desk. More dandelions. A back yard. A punching bag? Upside down, in color   then right-side up. A buzzing bee. The picture comes into focus. A goat head on the wall. A woman walks up the stairs. Dandelions. A sharp breeze. Life, to death; and from death, life.<br />\n<br />\nOkay, fine. You explain it to me, then. You've got until August 29 to figure it out; after that, the doors to PAX will be flung open, and all the secrets will be laid bare.","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1408400266,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":40800},{"gid":"552008372906692802","title":"The best living room PC games to play on the couch","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/552008372906692802","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"\n                                            <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/gallery/the-best-living-room-pc-games/\" \n                            rel=\"bookmark\" \n                            title=\"Permanent Link to The best living room PC games to play on the couch\"><img width=\"590\" height=\"331\" src=\"http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2014/08/livingroom-intro-610x343.jpg\" class=\"attachment-590x500 wp-post-image\" alt=\"The best living room PC games\" title=\"The best living room PC games\" /></a>\n                    <br />\n","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1407438056,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":21660},{"gid":"3189986872473895825","title":"Weekend Deal - Indie Game: The Movie, 75% Off","url":"http://store.steampowered.com/news/13633/","is_external_url":false,"author":"Valve","contents":" \nSave 75% on the <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/sub/45657/'>Indie Game: The Movie Bundle</a> as part of this week's Weekend Deal*!<br><br>To Celebrate the 2 year Anniversary of <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/207080/\">Indie Game The Movie</a> we are offering 75% off the <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/sub/45657/'>Indie Game: The Movie Bundle</a>.
