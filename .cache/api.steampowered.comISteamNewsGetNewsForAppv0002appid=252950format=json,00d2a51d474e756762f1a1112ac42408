Most streamers who are at the top of their game didn't grow up with aspirations of making their living as a professional Twitch partner. It's a passion that was cultivated over the span of a few recent years. Owning a Twitch channel with more than 2.5 million views and becoming one of the most popular streamers in the [b][i]Rocket League[/i][/b] community can start as a hobby without a career on the horizon.\n\nRewind the clock to 2017. [i]Rocket League[/i] was in its infancy. Athena, who was better known by her real name Alejandra, was studying marketing at community college in Austin, Texas. At that time, she was on a traditional career path, and her goal was to transfer to a university after the semester. She didn't know exactly how she would apply her marketing knowledge, but she knew she liked video games and people. Then someone gave her a suggestion that would change the trajectory of her career: the suggestion to start her own channel on Twitch.\n\n\"I never dreamed of a future as a [i]Rocket League[/i] streamer,\" Athena recalls. \"One of my friends said I should stream. At the time, I didn't even know what Twitch or streaming was. I didn't have a good computer setup when I started. My PC was connected to a TV in my parent's place. Everything started small.\"\n\nThe Austin-native loved video games at an early age thanks to an older brother and father who enjoyed the hobby. That love started with games on the GameCube like [i]Super Smash Bros. Melee[/i] and [i]The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess[/i] on the Wii, but she never thought a career would materialize out of it.\n\nDespite starting small, it didn't take long for her stream to become profitable. While most streamers have to grind for months before breaking through, Athena started making money from her channel just two weeks after the launch thanks to a generous donation from a viewer. This was a surprise to her, but especially to her parents. She was faced with the difficult task of explaining to them how streaming could be a viable avenue for her. This was particularly challenging considering Twitch, and donations given by viewers, were foreign concepts to them.\n\n\"I remember when I received my first big donation. I stopped mid-stream and I went to my parents room, and I will never forget the look on their faces,\" Athena laughs. \"They told me I had to return it. They were horrified. I really had to talk them down. My parents had a traditional career path in mind for me: college and a 9-to-5 job. I'm glad I was able to show them another world.\"\n\nThe purpose of the donation was to get an improved streaming setup. She used it to upgrade her facecam and headset. She was even able to upgrade her home's internet to enhance the quality of the stream. With the tools for a top-notch stream ready to go, Athena's channel took off. She became a Twitch partner just four months after starting her stream.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/S3h2wJj.jpg[/img]\n\nThe stream was on a steady rise throughout its two years. Then, this year on June 17, she made a big move by signing with G2 Esports as a content creator. It's a decision that Athena says she always dreamed of, but never thought of as a realistic one.\n\n\"When G2 reached out, I was a bit shocked at first,\" Athena says. \"It was really unexpected. For me to join an org with my brand, I really wanted it to be something I believed in, but I also wanted it to be a good fit for me so I could represent them well. G2 was the fit I was looking for. It took my stream to a whole new level. I'm so thankful for the people who stuck with me, believed in me, pushed me to be a better person so I could reach new goals that I never would've thought were achievable. I'm just really, really thankful for G2 and my audience.\"\n\nNot only was the signing a good fit for Athena's brand, but it was also a good fit for her on a personal level. Her longtime boyfriend, Dillon \"Rizzo\" Rizzo, plays for G2's [b]Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS)[/b] team. Surprisingly enough, that relationship made her hesitate at the idea of signing with them.\n\n\"With Dillon being a part of G2, I almost declined the offer,\" Athena says. \"As a professional streamer it's very important to me that I succeed on my own merits and not because of my relationship with a professional gamer. But, it's really cool that the same org would want to sponsor both Dillon and me. He's been nothing but an absolutely amazing person, both on a personal level and with his support in my move to G2. I'm really thankful for him.\"\n\nThe Twitch stream is booming, and she's a part of the same organization as Rizzo. Even though everything seems to be going perfectly, that doesn't mean it's easy work. Athena has to put in the work to sustain that growth. The target is streaming live seven days a week. On top of the streaming grind, there's added scrutiny that comes with being the top female [i]Rocket League[/i] streamer in a community that is still dominated by males. She says that there's added challenges that come with that territory.\n\n\"I think it's just something that every streamer goes through. It's one of the negatives that comes with being in a public space and having yourself out there. Everyone has their own opinions of you. I'm a big fan of streamers like Chellchee, Kiaa, and others who are doing their thing. They're tough cookies.\"\n\nSometimes the negativity that comes from making a living online means that taking time to yourself is a necessity. Athena doesn't like to obsess over the negative comments or lost subs. She says that if she needs to take a weekend away from her stream, she does. When she's not streaming, she enjoys playing the piano and traveling to [i]Rocket League[/i] events. If it means she can meet some of her audience, she's there. The influence that comes with having a successful Twitch channel isn't lost on her. She wants to see the female [i]Rocket League[/i] community grow. For any females thinking of creating [i]Rocket League[/i] content, she has this bit of advice:\n\n\"For the ladies out there who are just getting into streaming, especially in [i]Rocket League[/i], you've got this. If you show the world that you love to do this, they will accept you for who you are. If they don't, you can just ban them from your chat,\" she laughs. \"On Twitch, you are your own boss. No one else can tell you otherwise.\"\n\n\n\nCheck out Athena's channel at [url=https://www.twitch.tv/athena][b]Twitch.tv/Athena[/b][/url].","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1567104031,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":252950},{"gid":"2416665403788115195","title":"Patch Notes v1.66 [Season 12 Update]","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/2416665403788115195","is_external_url":true,"author":"Dirkened","contents":"[h1]THE HEADLINES[/h1][list]  [*]    Rocket Pass 4 begins on Wednesday, August 28 at 10:00 a.m. PDT / 5:00 p.m. UTC\n  [/*]  [*]    Competitive Season 11 Rewards will be awarded to eligible accounts\n  [/*]  [*]    Competitive Season 12 begins\n  [/*][/list]\n[h1]NEW CONTENT[/h1]\n[b]Rocket Pass 4[/b]\n\n  [list]    [*]      Rocket Pass 4 begins on August 28 at 10:00 a.m. PDT / 5:00 p.m. UTC\n    [/*]    [*]      Weekly Challenges will remain active throughout the entire Rocket Pass\n      [list]        [*]          Example: Week 3 Challenges can be completed in Week 4, 5, and onward until the conclusion of the Rocket Pass they’re included with\n        [/*]        [*]          If you purchase Rocket Pass Premium after Rocket Pass 4 has begun, you will be able to access previous week’s Premium Challenges\n        [/*]      [/list]    [/*]  [/list]  \n  \n[b]Competitive Season 11 Rewards[/b]\n  [list]    [*]      Competitive Season 11 has ended.

Your teammate has possession, and passes it your way from the wall. You place the shot above the backboard where your opponent can't reach it, launch your car into the air with your remaining boost and follow up the backboard shot with a perfectly placed goal. The Goal Explosion ignites as time expires. The exhilaration is nearly tangible. But meanwhile, there are hundreds of sound effects occurring inside the game that supplement all the excitement of the moment: the siren, the announcer, the crowd, and that only scratches the surface. In moments like this, it may be easy to overlook the sound of [b][i]Rocket League[/i][/b], but these sounds are an essential part of the experience.\n\nThe audio team at Psyonix works tirelessly on the sounds within these moments so [i]Rocket League[/i] is able to achieve maximum levels of hype. Recently, the team that consists of sound designer Stephen Lichota, technical sound designer Miles Flanagan, and audio director Mike Ault has been hard at work on bringing High-Dynamic Range (HDR) Audio to the game. In today's world of 4K screens, the term \"HDR\" is usually reserved for vivid imagery on televisions, but it's also a part of the audio world. HDR Audio may share the name of HDR imaging, but it's a different concept entirely. While you need an HDR television to enjoy HDR programming, HDR Audio doesn't require any additional hardware and is specifically designed for video games. It enhances the mix of the audio so players will be able to more clearly hear the sounds that are important in the moment. That's the simplest way to describe this audio system that is anything but simple.\n\n\"HDR Audio is one of the hardest things to explain,\" says Stephen. \"Even when we're constantly working with it, it can still throw your brain for a loop. Normally, you have a fader that you can adjust to make certain sound effects louder than others. It doesn't quite work like that in HDR Audio. It doesn't make sound louder. Instead, it makes other sounds quieter so there's an emphasis on specific sounds. So, then you're trying to listen for the things that the system is altering.\"\n\nThat's essentially what [i]Rocket League's[/i] upgrade to HDR Audio is going to do. The sounds that are more important will be prioritized in a way so that they can be heard more clearly when they happen. \"The whole goal is for you to hear what you want to hear the most,\" Mike explains. \"So, you hear other cars, and you hear positional information better like where the ball is. Extra sound effects like crowd and ambience are moving out of the way. It all gives you a cleaner sense of the game.\"\n\nThis new sound mix didn't happen overnight. HDR Audio was attempted in the past, as early as the game's Neo Tokyo Arena release in 2016. But, that audio overhaul came with some growing pains. The world of audio engineering is not an exact science. There's only so much testing you do before the game is being played in online conditions. It's nearly impossible to recreate every combination of audio cues that could possibly happen in any given match. Plus, each update with new Boosts, Arenas, Battle-Cars, and Goal Explosions adds to the ever-growing library of sound effects.\n\n\"[i]Rocket League[/i] is in its fifth year,\" Mike says. \"There's so much sound-related content when you consider boosts, crowd noise, engine audio and so much more. Then, you stack 20 or 30 of those sounds at any given time. It can be pretty daunting to find where something is sounding wrong.\"\n\nIn addition to that challenge for the audio team, there's the issue of players experiencing the game's sound in vastly different environments. Some players rely on speakers built into a TV or monitor, while others may have high-fidelity sound systems. Most players, however, use headphones during their gaming sessions. In the past, [i]Rocket League's[/i] audio mixes were primarily designed on top-notch sound systems, but that's not how most people are listening to the game's audio. The HDR Audio update is the game's first audio mix that was designed with a focus on headphones.\n\n\"When we did our last mix, we were doing it in one of our rooms in super high fidelity and listening to the audio at a louder volume than our community listening at home at night could realistically reproduce,\" Mike explains. \"We created a very dynamic mix that we thought sounded fantastic. The vast majority of our players don't play [i]Rocket League[/i] that way. So, rightfully so, we got a wide range of player feedback. This time, we took every step we could to recreate listening situations that our playerbase commonly experiences.\"\n\nThroughout the development of this mix, the team played different games that handle dynamics in various ways. One game that stood out as an audio benchmark was Rainbow Six: Siege. According to the team, the sound design of Siege stands with its range dynamics of tensely quiet and bombastically loud states. Miles says that while this design can help guide the direction of [i]Rocket League[/i], [i]Rocket League[/i] is a different beast entirely. \"In [i]Rocket League[/i], you're driving a car that's accelerating and boosting nearly all the time,\" he explains. \"That's essentially the only state of play, whereas Siege has two very different general levels of audio. It's a different case, but we can definitely take some useful cues from Siege.\"\n\nOne of those cues is to bring adjustable Dynamic Range Controls to [i]Rocket League[/i] in a future update after HDR Audio hits the game and the team is able to monitor player feedback.\n\nOnce HDR Audio rolls out with the next update, the best advice Mike can give: have an open mind when you hear the changes for the first time. \"There's this phenomenon in the audio world called 'temp love,'\" he explains. \"It says that people get attached to what they're used to. We're asking people to give it a chance. It will sound different. If it didn't sound different, then it defeats the purpose of remixing the audio. We genuinely feel that this is a major improvement and hope people approach it with an open mind. We're looking forward to hearing community feedback and using that to create the best possible listening experience.\"\n\nLook out for HDR Audio in [i]Rocket League's[/i] next update scheduled for August 27.","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1565283759,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":252950},{"gid":"2412160539851671213","title":"Some Rocket League players are furious about the upcoming loot box removal","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/pcgamer/2412160539851671213","is_external_url":true,"author":"","contents":"<p></p>\n<p>As more proof that there&apos;s absolutely nothing we can all agree on, the news that Psyonix will be removing paid loot boxes from Rocket League has had a mixed response. There&apos;s a lot of support for the decision in the replies to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RocketLeague/status/1158800213793898496\" target=\"_blank\">the announcement tweet</a>, but also cries that Epic, which recently purchased Psyonix, is &quot;ruining&quot; the game.</p><p>There are some good questions in the thread. It&apos;s the keys used to open crates that cost money in Rocket League, not the crates themselves, and some players use keys as a trading currency. Players want to know if their big key stashes will still be worth anything after the change, or if they should open all their crates right now.</p><p>But many others seem to just like the loot boxes. Ultra-rare Black Market items are status symbols in Rocket League, and a community has formed around collecting and opening crates. YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYyVZvXGbxgPlicRnkErEQ\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Sandman</a> regularly gets over 100K views on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Nscp_Uocs\" target=\"_blank\">crate opening videos</a>.</p>\n<p>It can be hard to tell what&apos;s shitposting and what&apos;s actual rage on social media, but the number of angry responses indicates that there&apos;s real opposition to the paid loot box removal, which may come as a surprise if you&apos;ve been following the general discussion around the practice for the past few years.</p><p>Ever since <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/eas-new-chief-game-designer-promises-to-avoid-repeats-of-battlefront-2s-loot-box-controversy/\">the Battlefront 2 debacle</a>, criticism from players, press, and governments has led publishers to defend loot boxes, remove them, or <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-ea-ubisoft-and-others-agree-to-start-sharing-loot-box-odds/\">publish drop rates</a> as a concession. Our readers overwhelmingly express distaste for loot boxes when we report on them. See the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pcgamer/status/1141677229690228737\" target=\"_blank\">replies to this tweet</a>, for instance.</p><p>There are plenty of Rocket League players who are happy paid loot boxes are going away&#x2014;Rocket League pro Tigreee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TigreeeRL/status/1158815687571386369?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">responded with hearts</a>&#x2014;but clearly the idea that everyone hates them is false. When a community of traders and YouTubers and fashion aficionados forms around the practice, as it has in other games as well, opinions start to vary. (There&apos;s also some generalized Epic hate involved here.)</p>\n<p>Personally, I&apos;m glad paid loot boxes are going. I admit I&apos;ve occasionally enjoyed having ultra-rare items, but to get that stuff I&apos;ve spent a lot of money on crap that just clogs my inventory until I can trade it up. I&apos;d much rather be able to express myself with themed car designs without having to throw money away on decals I&apos;ll never use.</p><p>Besides, pretty much everyone I play with and against in Diamond-level Snow Day is decked out with animated decals and fancy goal explosions and painted wheels. It&apos;s how you put those things together that&apos;s interesting these days.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1565212521,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":252950},{"gid":"2412160539850390344","title":"No more upsetting unboxing as Rocket League loses loot crates","url":"https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/2412160539850390344","is_external_url":true,"author":"contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Craig Pearson)","contents":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/rl_cross-play_asset_no-text.f44ca8609585ba611e1277fc600f5cc1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/rl_cross-play_asset_no-text.f44ca8609585ba611e1277fc600f5cc1.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg//RPSS/resize/670x-1/format/jpg/\" width=\"670\" /></a></p>\n<p>Psyonix   s <a href=\"https://www.rocketleague.com/news/crates-leaving-rocket-league-later-this-year/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> has announced that they   re taking paid for randomised loot boxes out of their soccar game (that looks like a typo, but it   s an excellent pun), <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/rocket-league/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rocket League</a>.

Rocket Pass 3 will be live until August 27, however no new Weekly Challenges will be added. The next Rocket Pass will begin on August 28.\n\nThe next Rocket Pass will slightly change the Weekly Challenge System. Weekly Challenges will stay active throughout its duration.

As stated above, Competitive Season 11 will end on August 27 and Season 12 will begin on the same day following a title update. We'll reveal the next Season Rewards as we get closer to the end of the season.\n\nLike previous Competitive Seasons, there will be unique rewards for Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Champion, and Grand Champion ranks. Plus, unique Extra Mode Grand Champion titles are returning from previous seasons.\n\nBe sure to keep grinding those ranks over the next month. You have to complete your placement matches in a Competitive Playlist and fulfill the appropriate Season Reward Level in order to earn your rewards for Competitive Season 11.\n\n\n\n[h1][b]AUDIO CHANGES INCOMING![/b][/h1]\nListen up! As we heard the reception to our audio changes from the previous update, we are making additional changes in the next one. High Dynamic Range Audio will be ready to rock and roll as a part of the next game update on August 27, which we hope will be music to your ears! Stay tuned for an in-depth look at the new sound of Rocket League in the next couple weeks.\n\n\n\n[h1][b]ON THE HORIZON[/b][/h1]\n[*]New Stats[/*]\n\nTwo new stats are being added to all game modes: “High Five” and “Low Five.” Pull off a High Five by hitting your teammate in midair after scoring. Low Five is the same thing, but on field level. Plus, Hoops is getting its own new stat called \"Swish.\" As the name suggests, Swish is achieved by scoring without the ball touching the rim.\n\n[*]Return of Haunted Hallows[/*]\n\nWe're in the planning stages of our third installment of Haunted Hallows, which is coming this fall. We know that following Radical Summer is a tough act to follow, but we're cooking up some wicked new content!\n\n[*]New and improved tournaments[/*]\n\nOne of the goals in 2019 is to revamp Rocket League's Tournament system. Think of it as Tournaments 2.0. This would include having automated, scheduled tournaments in-game that players could join. Look out for more info on the revamped Tournaments system later this year.\n\n[*]Regarding the last Roadmap[/*]\n\nContent that was discussed in May's Roadmap including the Party-Up System, Inventory Management, and quality-of-life improvements to the player-to-player trading system are still in development.

It's been an incredible journey for us that spans what amounts to an entire high school career.\n\nWe think that's a fitting comparison too, because just like high school graduation, those four years are only the beginning of what we believe will be a long and prosperous move into maturity and bigger and better things. [i]Rocket League[/i] is in it for the long haul. We firmly believe that our game will continue to grow and improve—not only for many years to come, but for many [i]generations[/i] as well.\n\nCase in point: in the time since [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-third-birthday/][b]we last talked about our third birthday[/b][/url], we've seen an enormous amount of progress for Rocket League and the industry as a whole. In just the last year alone, we launched our new and highly successful [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-launches-on-september-5/][b]Rocket Pass initiative[/b][/url], giving players yet another way to enjoy and unlock in-game content; along with the recently added (and highly requested) [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-3-and-weekly-challenges-revealed/][b]\"Weekly Challenges\" feature[/b][/url], that expands the Rocket Pass concept even further.\n\nIn that same year, we've also added a ton of additional content in partnership with massive brands like [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/new-hot-wheels-triple-threat-dlc-pack-september-24/][b]Hot Wheels[/b][/url], [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/mclaren-570s-car-pack-available-now/][b]McLaren[/b][/url], [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/shazam-items-soar-into-rocket-league/][b]Shazam[/b][/url], and [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/take-the-field-with-the-mlb-fan-pack/][b]Major League Baseball[/b][/url] to please fans of multiple backgrounds and interests, while also tapping into one of the greatest decades of all time—the 1980s—to bring classic IPs like [i]Ghostbusters, Knight Rider, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, The Karate Kid, Voltron, The Goonies, and WWE[/i] to [i]Rocket League[/i]; courtesy of our biggest in-game event ever, [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/get-ready-for-radical-summer/][b]Radical Summer[/b][/url]!\n\nThe last 12 months have also allowed us to achieve some of our most ambitious goals in the history of our studio. Specifically, [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/full-cross-platform-play-now-live-in-rocket-league/][b]TRUE cross-platform play[/b][/url], that allows you to play Rocket League with friends on ALL platforms, finally became a reality this past January when we joined Fortnite as the first two games to ever offer such a ground-beaking feature. That cross-play experience was made even better by the [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/cross-platform-party-summer-roadmap-update/][b]cross-platform parties[/b][/url] function you have patiently waited for over the years. And let's not forget about [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/new-monstercat-music-coming-to-rocket-league-all-year-long/][b]our partners at Monstercat[/b][/url], who continue to introduce new songs and artists to Rocket League in-game (and for FREE) throughout the year!\n\nRocket League's Esports ecosystem is bigger and brighter than ever too! [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rlcs-season-6-world-championship-is-heading-to-vegas-/][b]RLCS Season 6[/b][/url] introduced our first-ever $1 million prize pool in Las Vegas, while last month's [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/presenting-your-rlcs-season-7-world-champions-/][b]RLCS Season 7 World Championship[/b][/url] saw our most-attended event thus far, packing thousands of rabid fans into the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey! But that's just the tip of the iceberg for what's been a massive year for RLE, which includes:\n[list]\n[*][url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/let-s-talk----south-america/][b]South America[/b][/url] joining North America, Europe, and Oceania in RLCS7\n[*]The launch of the DreamHack Pro Circuit and $100,000 prize pools ($400K total) at four different events\n[*]Collegiate Rocket League's [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/crl-spring-invitational-coming-to-ncaa-final-four-in-minneapolis/][b]first-ever Spring Invitational[/b][/url], held live at the NCAA Final Four in Minneapolis, Minnesota\n[*]The [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/the-eleague-cup--rocket-league-returns-this-weekend-/][b]return of the ELEAGUE Cup[/b][/url] with a $150,000 prize pool, in addition to a multi-part ELEAGUE Feature Series that covers the players, teams, and stories of RLCS Seasons 7 and 8\n[*]The launch of the [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/esports-shop-a-closer-look/][b]oft-requested in-game Esports Shop[/b][/url], which allows players to purchase items to represent their favorite teams, with 30% of the revenue going to the participating organizations and an additional portion of revenue going to the RLCS League Play prize pool[/*][/list]\nLast but certainly not least, comes our biggest news of the year—that Psyonix and Rocket League [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/psyonix-is-joining-the-epic-family-/][b]officially joined the Epic Games family[/b][/url] in late Spring! We couldn't be more thrilled to join forces with the same team that created Fortnite, Unreal Tournament, and the foundation on which Rocket League was built—the Unreal Engine—to ensure that we can bring you bigger and better things for years and years to come. With the expanded resources and support that Epic Games provides, we are confident that Rocket League's reach and potential will soar to levels we couldn't have previously imagined.\n\nOne last thing before we go (and we know we say it every year, but that's because it's true): ALL of [i]Rocket League's[/i] continued success is because of YOU—our fans and our community. Your support, your passion, and your dedication is incredibly important to us, and we hope to make you proud, keep you happy, and (hopefully) continue to surprise you in the best possible ways.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Psyonix team, thank you so much for another great year of [i]Rocket League[/i]!

As if the start of [b]Radical Summer's[/b] Culture phase weren't enough, we're adding to the party by activating a Double Drop and Double Painted Weekend starting July 4.\n\nDuring this weekend-long event, all Uncommon or higher free customization items and active Crates will drop twice as often after Online Matches of any game type. Plus, all Crates will have double the chance of containing Painted items. If you're holding onto Crates in your inventory, this is the perfect time to open them. The Double Painted bonus also applies to Trade-Ins. All Trade-Ins processed during this weekend will have double the chance of receiving a Painted item.\n\nThe Double Painted item increase only applies to Crates and Trade-Ins, and not Golden Items from in-game events. This is because Golden Items already have increased odds of containing Painted Items. Be sure to check out the drop rates for Crates [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/drop-rates-in-rocket-league-crates/][b]here[/b][/url].

That means there are brand new items in the Event Store featuring the tightest trends from the 1980s. Pixelated Wheels? Totally. A VCR topper? Duh. An enormous cell phone? Like, for sure! Plus there's an all new limited-time game mode called Spike Rush that you'll dig big time.\n\nTo celebrate [b][i]Rocket League's[/i][/b] 4th Birthday, we're taking the action back to Throwback Stadium, but gameplay is taking a sharp turn. Radical Summer's second phase introduces the all new limited-time game mode Spike Rush. In this 3v3 mode, every player has the Spike power-up from Rumble. Players who have possession of the ball lose all boost, but can disengage their spikes to perform some wicked shots or passing plays. But be careful! The ball carrier is demolished on contact. We can't wait to see what smooth moves you're able to pull off in this wild mode.\n\nBe on the lookout for the new [b]Totally Awesome Crate[/b], which will start dropping today. The Crate itself fits perfectly with Radical Summer's '80s style. As for what's inside, check out the new hot hatchback Fennec pictured below. The Totally Awesome Crate contains over a dozen customizations. In-game items from this crate are subject to the same drop rates as our previous Crates, which you can find [url=https://www.rocketleague.com/news/drop-rates-in-rocket-league-crates/][b]here[/b][/url].\n\nRadical Summer's Culture phase will be live until July 22, so jump into Online Matches, start earning Cassettes, enjoy Spike Rush, and stay radical!","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1562002843,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":252950}],"count":631}}
